Morgan Healthcare Conference\\n\\n\\n\\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\n\\n\\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain.\\n\\nForward-looking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to, statements about: the potential attributes and benefits of our product candidates; the format, timing and objectives of our product development activities and clinical trials; the timing and outcome of regulatory interactions, including whether trials meet the criteria to serve as registrational; the ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of treatments for relevant indications; the size and growth potential of the markets for product candidates and ability to serve those markets; the rate and degree of market acceptance of product candidates, if approved; and the sufficiency of our cash runway.\\n\\nWe cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this presentation will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if the forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. Actual performance and results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others: clinical trial results may not be favorable; uncertainties inherent in the product development process (including with respect to the timing of results and whether such results will be predictive of future results); the impact of COVID-19 and the post-COVID landscape on the timing, progress and results of clinical trials; our ability to recruit and enroll suitable patients in our clinical trials; whether and when, if at all, our product candidates will receive approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and for which, if any, indications; competition from other biotechnology companies; uncertainties regarding intellectual property protection; and other risks identified in our SEC filings, including those under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 8, 2022 and our subsequent SEC filings.\\n\\nIn light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this presentation represent our views as of the date of this presentation. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this presentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t©

Morgan Healthcare ConferenceForward-Looking StatementsThis presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain.Forward-looking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to, statements about: the potential attributes and benefits of our product candidates; the format, timing and objectives of our product development activities and clinical trials; the timing and outcome of regulatory interactions, including whether trials meet the criteria to serve as registrational; the ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of treatments for relevant indications; the size and growth potential of the markets for product candidates and ability to serve those markets; the rate and degree of market acceptance of product candidates, if approved; and the sufficiency of our cash runway.We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this presentation will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if the forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. Actual performance and results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others: clinical trial results may not be favorable; uncertainties inherent in the product development process (including with respect to the timing of results and whether such results will be predictive of future results); the impact of COVID-19 and the post-COVID landscape on the timing, progress and results of clinical trials; our ability to recruit and enroll suitable patients in our clinical trials; whether and when, if at all, our product candidates will receive approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and for which, if any, indications; competition from other biotechnology companies; uncertainties regarding intellectual property protection; and other risks identified in our SEC filings, including those under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 8, 2022 and our subsequent SEC filings.In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this presentation represent our views as of the date of this presentation. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this presentation.© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.2CEREVEL: Unraveling the Mysteries of the BrainA Deliberate and Differentiated Approach to Treating Neuroscience DiseasesTargeted NeurocircuitryCerevel unlocks new treatment opportunities by precisely identifying and targeting the neurocircuitry that underlies a given neuroscience disease.Receptor Subtype SelectivityCerevel is selectively targeting only the receptor subtype(s) related to the disease physiology, to minimize undesirable off-target effects while maximizing activity.Differentiated Pharmacology Cerevel designs full and partial agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators that canprecisely fine-tune the receptor pharmacologyand neurocircuit activity without over-activation or over-suppression of the endogenous physiologic range.Cerevel: Becoming the premier neuroscience companyPipelineExtensive pipeline to address schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease psychosis (ADP), epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and panic disorder; early-stage/preclinical programs to replenish pipelineMultiple data readouts expected in 2023, 2024, and beyondProgressCapitalEmraclidineOngoing Phase 2 program in schizophrenia and recently announced positive ABPM dataFDA Fast Track designation in ADPInitiated Phase 1 healthy elderly volunteer trial to support development in ADPDarigabatPositive Phase 1 data in acute anxiety in February 2022Phase 2 trial in panic disorder expected to initiate in Q2 2023Innovative dealmaking, strong balance sheet and experienced stewardship of capitalCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,030M as of 9/30/2022Disciplined spending with cash resources expected to support operations into 2025ABPM = ambulatory blood pressure monitoring© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.4Significant Patient Populations with High Unmet NeedSignificant Patient Populations with High Unmet NeedDeep Pipeline with Multiple Value Inflections AheadMultiple Programs Across All Stages of DevelopmentCANDIDATE SELECTIONINDPHASE 1PHASE 2PHASE 3TimingCANDIDATE SELECTIONINDPHASE 1PHASE 2PHASE 3TimingLEADPROGRAMSmer’s Disease Psymer’s Disease PsyAlzheiAlzheiTavapadonMonotherapy (Early) Parkinson’s | Adjunctive (Late) Parkinson’sUnder ReviewEmraclidine EmraclidineDarigabatchosisSchizophreniaEpilepsyData 1H 2024Initiated 4Q 2022Data Mid 2023Darigabat CVL-871Panic DisorderDementia-Related ApathyInitiation 2Q23Under ReviewEARLY- STAGE and PRECLINICAL PROGRAMSCVL-354 (KORA)CVL-047 (PDE4)M4 AgonistLRRK2Plus several undisclosed targets, including some with disease-modifying potential* In addition, there are three open-label extension trials ongoing (REALIZE OLE for darigabat in epilepsy , TEMPO-4 for tavapadon, and EMPOWER-3 for emraclidine)© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.5© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.6© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.6EMRACLIDINESelectively targeting the M4 muscarinic receptor with the goal of effectively treating psychosis-related symptoms and improving tolerability compared to standard of careSchizophreniaAlzheimer’s Disease PsychosisEmraclidine: A New Mechanism and Potential Next-Generation AntipsychoticOpportunity for Innovation in SchizophreniaCurrent Therapies Use Same Basic MoA as Drugs from the 1950sPotential as Best-in-Class with a New MoALarge Market Opportunity~20MPatients Worldwide~$7BG7 Revenues in 2018Limited~3.5%Growth Per YearHighSignificant Need for NewSide Effect andLead toCompliance60%Relapse Rates77%90%and BetterTolerated TherapiesTolerability IssuesHigh Discontinuation74%Progression andat 1 yearat 2 yearsLead toWithin 18 MonthsWorsening of DiseaseLead toDebilitating side effects of atypicals often lead to discontinuation, relapse, and a vicious cycle of disease progressionSource: World Health Organization, DRG Market Research© Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.7Emraclidine: Phase 1b Data Demonstrated Antipsychotic ActivityPANSS Total Score Change from Baseline LS Mean ± SEM§PANSS Total Score Change from Baseline LS Mean ± SEM§0-5-10-15-20-25PANSS Total Score******Clinically meaningful improvements in PANSS total scoreStatistically significant difference in PANSS total score versus placebo*Clinically meaningful improvements in both PANSS Positive and PANSS Negative subscalesGenerally well toleratedRecently published in0123456WeekThe LancetPlb (N=27)30 mg QD (N=27)20 mg BID (N=27)*P<0.05 vs Placebo ** P<0.01 vs Placebo§ Derived from a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, visit, treatment group-by-visit interaction as fixed effect, baseline value as a covariate and the measurements within subject as repeated measures.

Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain.\\n\\nForward-looking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to: statements about the potential attributes and benefits of our product candidates, including with respect to receptor subtype selectivity, activity, side effect and tolerability profile and relevant indications; the format and timing of our product development activities; the timing and outcome of regulatory interactions; the ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of treatments for relevant indications; the size and growth potential of the markets for product candidates and ability to serve those markets; and the rate and degree of market acceptance of product candidates, if approved.\\n\\nWe cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this presentation will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if the forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. Actual performance and results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others: uncertainties inherent in the product development process (including with respect to the timing of results and whether such results will be predictive of future results); whether and when, if at all, our product candidates will receive approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and for which, if any, indications; competition from other biotechnology companies; uncertainties regarding intellectual property protection; and other risks identified in our SEC filings, including those under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023 and our subsequent SEC filings.\\n\\nIn light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this presentation represent our views as of the date of this presentation. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law.

All rights reserved.\\n\\n\\n\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\n\\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements,” which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Such statements may contain words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “prepare,” “look,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “possible,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable words. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: our plans to deliver precision-based therapies to improve the lives of patients and their families and to target a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases; plans to discover and develop novel therapeutics to leverage microglial biology, such as VGL101 and small molecules active against TREM2, and to enable success in ALSP in clinical development; beliefs about TREM2 agonism’s importance in Alzheimer’s disease; beliefs about the profiles and potential, including the commercial potential, of our pipeline and the strength of our intellectual property position; our analyses and beliefs about data, including pathology and disease biomarkers and the signaling, engagement and potency as an agonism of TREM2 in microglia; plans and upcoming milestones, including estimated timelines, for our pipeline program development activities and pipeline expansion opportunities; expected timing and next steps regarding data announcement, clinical trial activities and regulatory filings and approvals; expectations regarding our ability to develop and advance our current and future product candidates and discovery programs; and the belief that we are well-positioned to execute on our mission.\\n\\nThese forward-looking statements, which are only predictions, involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding our business. As such, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those predicted in our forward-looking statements include, among others, risks and uncertainties related to product development, including delays or challenges that may arise in the development and regulatory approval of our current and future product candidates or programs; uncertainties as to the availability and timing of results and data from preclinical and clinical studies; the timing of our ability to submit and obtain regulatory clearance for investigational new drug applications and initiate additional clinical trials; our ability to initiate and complete our current and expected clinical trials; our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic relationships and supply arrangements, or that we will not realize the intended benefits from such relationships or arrangements; whether our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; our ability to raise additional funding on favorable terms, or at all; the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our product candidates; the ability and willingness of our third-party collaborators to continue research and development activities relating to our product candidates; the accuracy of our data analyses or estimates for the potential and market for our products; our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to protect our intellectual property and to conduct activities for the development and commercialization of our candidates in view of third party intellectual property positions; our financial performance; our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, as well as the potential contribution of our employees and board to our growth and success as a Company; developments and projections relating to our competitors or our industry; the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including mitigation efforts and economic impacts, on any of the foregoing or other aspects of our business operations, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials; changes in general economic conditions and global instability, in particular economic conditions in the markets on which we or our suppliers operate; changes in laws and regulations; and those risks and uncertainties identified in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including under the heading “Risk Factors” in our most-recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and such other risks and uncertainties that may be described in subsequent filings we may make with the SEC.\\n\\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events or performance, or as a representation or warranty (express or implied) by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, on such specified terms, or at all. Although our management believes that the expectations reflected in our statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements are made. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\\n\\n2\\n\\n© Vigil Neuroscience, Inc. 2023.

      "The key asset described in the text is the \"Site-specific protein conjugation platform (Valanx Biotech)\". This platform is based on a synthetic amino acid urea-Tet-Lys (uTL) which is incorporated at any defined site in any recombinantly expressed protein during protein translation. The platform allows for complete freedom to choose the position and the number of uTLs within the proteins. The uTL contains a tetrazine click-reactive side chain which can be conjugated to any conjugation partner. The platform supports very fast conjugation reactions, taking approximately 20 minutes to achieve more than 99% completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The platform is unique in its ability to provide site-specific protein conjugation with complete freedom to choose the site and number of conjugations. This is a significant improvement over alternative conjugation methods which lack either specificity or are limited in choosing the site or number of conjugations. The platform has been established in E. coli and CHO cells, and offers four different synthetic amino acids with different conjugation chemistries available.\n",

    "\n",
    "Valanx Biotech is a private biotech startup company founded in 2021 and based in Austria. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Asset: Site-specific protein conjugation platform (Valanx Biotech)\n",
    "\n",
    "Valanx Biotech has developed a proprietary site-specific protein conjugation platform technology based on synthetic amino acids. The technology allows conjugation of proteins at precisely defined sites, with the ability to choose the site and number of conjugations. The platform has been established in both E. coli and CHO expression systems. It utilizes fast click-chemistry conjugation reactions, taking only ~20 minutes to reach >99% conjugation. The platform is at the stage of being ready for co-development projects and out-licensing. Compared to other conjugation methods, it offers superior specificity in choosing sites while retaining fast kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Asset: E. coli expression host (Valanx Biotech) \n",
    "\n",
    "Valanx has a fully developed E. coli expression host with high efficiency incorporation of the synthetic amino acid into proteins. The incorporation system is integrated into the genome. Fermentation processes have been successfully tested. The E. coli platform is ready for co-development or licensing. It allows production of proteins with sites for specific conjugation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Asset: CHO expression host (Valanx Biotech)\n",
    "\n",
    "Valanx has transferred the incorporation system to CHO cells. They have successfully expressed and conjugated proteins including antibodies like trastuzumab. The CHO platform allows transient expression and production of research-grade protein conjugates. It provides the ability to freely choose sites for conjugation in antibodies or proteins of interest.\n",

In particu- lar, the present invention pertains to methods of treating or preventing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and their associated symptoms by administration ofibudilast (3-isobu\\xad\\n\\n\\ncorticodentatinigral degeneration. Additional subjects can be suffering from progressive neurodegenerative disease that mainly afflicts young adults and children and include Haller\\xad vorden-Spatz disease and progressive familial myoclonic epi\\xad lepsy, progressive neurodegenerative disease that includes\\n\\n\\n\\ntyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[l ,5-a]pyridine).\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\\n\\n\\n\\nThe small molecule ibudilast (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropy\\xad lpyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridine) is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, lOAl and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006). Ibudilast also acts as a leukotriene D4 antagonist, an anti-inflamma\\xad tory, a PAF antagonist, and a vasodilatory agent (Thompson Current Drug Reports). Ibudilast is thought to exert a neuro\\xad protective role in the central nervous system of mammals, presumably via suppression of the activation of glial cells (Mizuno et al., Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411, 2004).\\n\\nIbudilast has been widely used in Japan for relieving symp\\xad toms associated with ischemic stroke or bronchial asthma. In recent clinical trials, its use in the treatment of multiple scle\\xad rosis (MS), an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, has been explored (News.Medical.Net; Pharmaceu\\xad tical News, 2Aug. 2005).As disclosed in this publication, this clinical trial was expected to treat \"relapsing-remitting MS,\" however, no mention is made of progressive multiple sclero\\xad sis. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,747, ibudilast is disclosed as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, which is generally under\\xad stood to mean relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, not progressive multiple sclerosis. US Patent Application No. 20060160843 discloses ibudilast for the treatment of inter\\xad mittent and short term pain, however, this is not pain related to a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\\n\\nWhile the use of ibudilast for a number of varying indica\\xad tions has been reported to date, to the best of the applicants\\' knowledge, its use in treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases has heretofore remained largely unexplored.\\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\n\\n\\n\\nThe present invention relates to a novel approach to treat\\xad ing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and is based upon the surprising discovery that progressive neurodegenerative diseases can be successfully treated or prevented by admin\\xad istration of ibudilast. Using standard progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases models, the inventors have discovered that the systemic administration of ibudilast is effective in\\n\\n\\n25 syndromes of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and movement, or disease that includes paralysis agitans (Par\\xad kinson\\'s disease), striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclearpalsy, torsion dystonia (torsion spasm; dystonia musculorum deformans), spasmodic torticollis and other\\n\\n30 restricted dyskinesias, Familial tremor, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, syndromes of progressive ataxia, cerebel\\xad lar degenerations or spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebel\\xad lar cortical degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), spinocerebellar degenerations including spinocer-\\n\\n35 ebellar degenerations (Friedreich\\'s ataxia and related disor\\xad\\n\\nders). Other indications include central autonomic nervous system failure (Shy-Drager syndrome), syndromes of mus\\xad cular weakness and wasting without sensory changes (motor neuron disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal\\n\\n40 muscular atrophy, infantile spinal muscular atrophy (Werd\\xad nig-Hoffmann), juvenile spinal muscular atrophy (Wohlfart\\xad Kugelberg-Welander), or other forms of familial spinal mus\\xad cular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis or hereditary spastic paraplegia, syndromes combining muscular weakness and\\n\\n45 wasting with sensory changes (progressive neural muscular atrophy; chronic familial polyneuropathies), peroneal mus\\xad cular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), hypertrophic intersti\\xad tial polyneuropathy (Deferine-Sottas), or miscellaneous forms of chronic progressive neuropathy, progressive neuro-\\n\\n50 degenerative diseases that include syndromes of progressive visual loss. Other indications treatable with the present inven\\xad tion are pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pig\\xad mentosa), or hereditary optic atrophy (Leber\\'s disease), motor neuron disease and the progressive ataxias; sporadic\\n\\n55 progressive neurodegenerative diseases, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, motor neuropathy with paraproeinemia, motor-predominant peripheral neuropa\\xad thies, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Azorean (Machado-Jo\\xad seph) disease, familial progressive neurodegenerative dis-\\n\\n60 eases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, familial spastic paraparesis, hereditary biochemical disorders, arthrogryposis muliplex congenital, or progressive juvenile bulbar palsy (Fazio-Londe)-Ex\\xad amples of hereditary biochemical disorders are superoxide\\n\\n65 dismutase deficieny, hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, or androgen receptor mutation (Kennedy\\'s syndrome). Further\\xad more, progressive neurodegenerative diseases can include\\n\\n\\n\\nviral and prion diseases, such as HTLV-1 associated myel\\xad opathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, kuru, fatal familial insomnia, or Alper\\'s disease.\\n\\nIn one or more alternative embodiments of the method, ibudilast is administered at a daily dosage amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily, or from about 30 mg to 180 mg daily, 60 mg to 120 mg daily, or 20 to 80 mg daily.\\n\\nThe therapeutic dosage amount may be achieved by admin\\xad istration once daily (i.e., in a single dose), twice daily (i.e., in two separate doses), three times daily, or may be administered as multiple doses over a time course of several days, weeks, or even months. Such administering is typically over a duration of time effective to result in a slowing (an inhibition) or\\n\\n\\ntional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenera\\xad tive diseases, for simultaneous, sequential or separate use.\\n\\nEach of the herein-described features of the invention is meant to apply equally to each and every embodiment as\\n\\n5  described herein, unless otherwise indicated.\\n\\nAdditional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part, will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following, or may be learned by practice of the\\n\\n10 invention.\\n\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\\n\\n\\n\\nFIG. 1 shows the percent change in brain volume of\\n\\n\\n\\ndimunition (a lessening), and ideally elimination or even 15 reversal, of a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Exem\\xad plary durations of treatment include at least about 1 month, from 1 to 3 months, up to about 6 months, up to about 12 months or even longer, such as 24 months or longer. In one particular embodiment, treatment lasts from about 1 week to 20 about 52 weeks.\\n\\nIn a preferred embodiment of the treatment method, the administering is over a duration of time effective to result in elimination of the progressive neurodegenerative disease.\\n\\n\\npatients in a Phase II clinical trial. Patients being adminis\\xad tered 60 mg a day ofibudilast had an average ofO.79% loss of brain volume, whereas patients being given a placebo had a brain volume loss of 1.2% over a I-year treatment period. This is a statistically significant result with a p value of 0.0352.\\n\\nFIG. 2 shows a significant reduction in brain volume loss (p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in MS patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch a time can be a least one year, for at least 20 months or\\n\\nfor at least two years.\\n\\nIn a specific embodiment of the invention, a method is described in which an effective amount of ibudilast is admin\\xad istered to patients suffering from a progressive form of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, who are at risk for conversion of their disease to secondary pro\\xad gressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), whereby the rate of con\\xad version from RRMS to SPMS is decreased by at least approximately half for such patients who are treated daily\\n\\n\\n25 A similar effect was observed in the relapsing-remitting patients.\\n\\nFIG. 3 shows results from a clinical trial in which patients who received placebo during the first 12 months of the trial were randomized to receive either 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per\\n\\n30 day (double-blind maintained) during the second 12 months of the trial; patients who received 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per day during the first 12 months remained on the assigned dose for the second 12 months of the trial.-Theresults of the trial showed that the significant reduction in brain volume loss\\n\\n\\n\\nwith an effective amount of ibudilast for a period of at least 35\\n\\ntwo years (compared, for example, to untreated patients or to patients treated daily for only one year). Thus, the present method includes a method of administering effective amounts of ibudilast to certain patient populations for at least about\\n\\ntwo years, at least about three years, at least about four years, 40\\n\\nor at least about five years and perhaps longer.\\n\\nIn yet another embodiment, ibudilast, when administered either singly or as part of a combination therapy, is adminis\\xad tered either systemically or centrally (e.g., by intrathecal administration, i.e., into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding 45 the spinal cord). Such administration of ibudilast provides a novel mechanism to attenuate progressive neurodegenerative diseases, potentially via suppression of glial activation.\\n\\nAccording to yet a further embodiment, ibudilast is admin\\xad istered systemically, e.g. via parenteral, enteral, oral, intrave- 50 nous, intranasal, sublingual or other systemic routes, to a human, subject for the treatment of progressive neurodegen\\xad erative diseases.\\n\\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a composition or combination effective for treating progressive neurodegen- 55 erative diseases. The composition comprises a combination\\n\\nof: (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, where each of the components is either contained in a single com\\xad position or dosage form (such as in an admixture), or is 60 present as a discrete or separate entity (e.g., in a kit).\\n\\nA composition of the invention may optionally include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\\n\\nIn yet another aspect, the invention encompasses a kit comprising a combination of medicaments for the treatment 65 of progressive neurodegenerative diseases or a related syn\\xad drome, comprising, (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one addi-\\n\\n\\n(p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo (FIG. 2) was again demonstrated in Year 2 and was significantly less (p=0.030) in patients receiving 60 mg per day ofMN-166 for 24 months compared to the other treatment groups (placebo for 12 months, 30 mg MN-166 for 12 months; placebo for 12\\n\\nmonths, 60 mg MN-166 for 12 months; 30 mg for 24 months).\\n\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\\n\\n\\n\\nThe practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of chemistry, bio\\xad chemistry, and pharmacology, within the skill of the art.

A progressive state is a worsening of symptoms over time. Generally, the symptoms worsen at a gradual rate.\\n\\nExamples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer\\'s Disease, Parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\\n\\nThe term \"central nervous system\" or \"CNS\" includes all cells and tissue of the brain and spinal cord of a vertebrate. Thus, the term includes, but is not limited to, neuronal cells, glial cells, astrocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), interstitial spaces and the like.\\n\\n\"Glial cells\" refer to various cells of the CNS also known as microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.\\n\\nThe terms \"subject\", \"individual\" or \"patient\" are used\\n\\ninterchangeably herein and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a\\n\\n\\n25 Examples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzhe\\xad imer\\'s disease, and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis exclusive ofrelapse/remitting multiple sclerosis.\\n\\nThere are four recognized types of multiple sclerosis: (1)\\n\\n30 Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclero\\xad sis), (2) Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP mul\\xad tiple sclerosis), (3) Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis), and (4) Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple sclerosis). RR multiple sclerosis is not\\n\\n35 considered to fall within the scope of the claims, but the other forms of multiple sclerosis, i.e. SP multiple sclerosis, PR multiple sclerosis and PP multiple sclerosis are considered to be one aspect of the present invention. In all types of progres\\xad sive MS, there is a loss of function over time regardless of\\n\\n40 relapses.\\n\\n\"Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclerosis)\" is characterized by relapses (also known as exac\\xad erbations) during which time new symptoms can appear and old ones resurface or worsen. The relapses are followed by\\n\\n45 periods of remission, during which time the person fully or partially recovers from the deficits acquired during the relapse. Relapses can last for days, weeks or months and recovery can be slow and gradual or almost instantaneous. The vast majority of people presenting with Multiple Sclero-\\n\\n50 sis are first diagnosed with relapsing/remitting. This is typi\\xad cally when they are in their twenties or thirties, though diag\\xad noses much earlier or later are known. Around twice as many women as men present with this variety.\\n\\nIn \"Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP multiple 55 sclerosis),\" a person who initially had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis begins to develop a gradual deterioration in nerve function, with or without relapses. After a number of years many people who have had relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis will pass into a secondary progressive phase of the\\n\\n60 disease. This is characterized by a gradual worsening of the disease between relapses. In the early phases of Secondary Progressive, the person may still experience a few relapses but after a while these merge into a general progression. People often do not return to their prior level of function after\\n\\n65 a relapse. People with secondary progressive may experience good and bad days or weeks, but, apart from some remission following relapsing episodes, have no real recovery. After 10\\n\\n\\n\\nyears, 50% of people with relapsing/remitting multiple scle\\xad rosis will have developed secondary progressive. By 25 to 30 years, that figure will have risen to 90%.\\n\\n\"Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis)\" shows clear progression in the level of disability 5 from the time symptoms first begin, but with episodes of clear relapses that may or may not be associated with some recov- ery following the acute episode. This form of multiple scle\\xad rosis follows a progressive course from onset, punctuated by relapses. There is significant recovery immediately following 10 a relapse but between relapses there is a gradual worsening of symptoms.\\n\\n\"Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple scle\\xad\\n\\n\\nsolvates, and the like, as appropriate for use in its intended formulation for administration.\\n\\nIbudilast is a is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, 10Al and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006), and has also been reported to have leukotriene D4 and PAF antagonistic activi- ties. Its profile appears effectively anti-inflammatory and unique in comparison to other PDE inhibitors and anti-in\\xad flanimatory agents. PDEs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phos\\xad phoester bond on the 3\\'-carbon to yield the corresponding 5\\'-nucleotide monophosphate. Thus, they regulate the cellu- lar concentrations of cyclic nucleotides. Since extracellular receptors for many hormones and neurotransmitters utilize cyclic nucleotides as second messengers, the PDEs also regu-\\n\\n\\n\\nrosis)\" is characterized by a gradual progression of the dis\\xad\\n\\nease from its onset with no remissions or relapses at all. There may be periods of a leveling off of disease activity and, as with secondary progressive, there may be good and bad days or weeks. PP multiple sclerosis differs from Relapsing/Re\\xad mitting and Secondary Progressive in that onset is typically in the late thirties or early forties, men are as likely women to develop it and initial disease activity is in the spinal cord and not in the brain. Primary Progressive multiple sclerosis often migrates into the brain, but is less likely to damage brain areas than relapsing/remitting or secondary progressive-for example, people with Primary Progressive are less likely to develop cognitive problems.\\n\\n\"Treatment\" or \"treating\" progressive neurodegenerative diseases includes arresting the development or reversing the symptom of a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\\n\\n\"Persistent neuronal or axon damage\" includes damage to neurons that is long term or permanent, such as when neurons die and disappear.\\n\\n\"Persistent black hole\" is defined as a hypointense lesion. Black holes, or dark areas on a Tl weighted magnetic reso\\xad nance imaging (MRI) scan, show loss of myelin and loss of axons. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, a Tl weighted scan uses longitudinal relaxation time a short relaxation time (TR) and short echo time (TE) (TR<l000 msec, TE<30 msec).\\n\\nIbudilast\\n\\nThe methods of the invention for the treatment of progres\\xad sive neurodegenerative diseases are based upon administra\\xad tion of the molecule, ibudilast. Ibudilast is a small molecule drug (molecular weight of230.3) having the structure shown below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIbudilast is also found under ChemBank ID 3227, CAS #50847-11-5, and Beilstein Handbook Reference No. 5-24- 03-00396. Its molecular formula corresponds to C14H18N20. Ibudilast is also known by various chemical names including\\n\\n2-methyl-1-(2-(1-methylethyl) pyrazolo(l ,5-a)pyridin-3-yl) 1-propanone; 3-isobutyry1-2-isopropylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyri\\xad dine]; and 1-(2-isopropyl-pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-2- methyl-propan-1-one. Other synonyms for ibudilast include Ibudilastum (Latin), BRN 0656579, KC-404, and MN-166. Its brand name is Ketas®. Ibudilast, as referred to herein, is meant to include any and all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, prodrug forms (e.g., the corresponding ketal),\\n\\n\\n15 late cellular responses to these extracellular signals. There are at least eight classes of PDEs: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PDEs (PDE!); cGMP-stimulated PDEs (PDE2); cGMP-in\\xad hibited PDEs (PDE3); cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4); cGMP\\xad binding PDEs (PDE5); photoreceptor PDEs (PDE6); high\\n\\n20 affinity, cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE7); and high affinity cGMP-specific PDEs (PDE9). Ibudilast acts to suppress inflammation via action on inflanimatory cells (e.g., glial cells) resulting in the suppression of both pro-inflammatory mediator and neuroactive mediator release. Ibudilast may\\n\\n25 also suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 \\' TNF-a) and may enhance the production of the anti\\xad inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10).

In some embodiments of this invention, administering to treat patients with multiple scle\\xad rosis is excluded.\\n\\nIbudilast may also be administered in combination with an additional agent effective for treating progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases. In a preferred embodiment, such agent possesses a mechanism of action different from ibudilast. Exemplary agents include cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g.,\\n\\n\\nRazadyne® (formerly known as Reminyl®) (galantamine), Exelon® (rivastigmine),Aricept® (donepezil), and Cognex® (tacrine)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitors (e.g., Namenda® (memantine)), levodopa preparations (e.g.,\\n\\n5 levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet® or Atamet®), levodopa/ benserazide (Madopar®), levodopa/carbiopa (Sinemet CR®), levodopa/benserazide (Madopar HBS®), carbidopa/ levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo®)), catechol-O-methyl trans\\xad ferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entacapone (Comtan®), tol-\\n\\n10 capone (Tasmar®)), dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine (Parlodel®), pergolide (Permax®), pramipexole (Mirapex®), ropinirole (Requip®), cabergoline (Dostinex®), apomorphine (Apokyn®), lisuride (Dopergine®)), immunomodulating drugs (e.g., interferon\\n\\n15 beta-la (Avonex®, Rebif®), interferon beta-lb (Betase\\xad ron®), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®), natalizumab (Tysa\\xad bri®)), immunosuppressant/chemotherapy drugs (e.g, mitox\\xad antrone (Novantrone®), azathioprine (Imuran®), cladribine (Leustatin®), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®), cyclosporine-\\n\\n20 A, methotrexate), oral medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (fingolimod (FTY720), BG12, laquinimod, teriflunomide), etc.\\n\\nPreferred methods of delivery of ibudilast-based therapeu\\xad tic formulations for the treatment of progressive neuropathic\\n\\n25 diseases include systemic and localized delivery. Such routes of administration include but are not limited to, oral, intra\\xad arterial, intrathecal, intraspinal, intramuscular, intraperito\\xad neal, intranasal, and inhalation routes.\\n\\nMore particularly, an ibudilast-based formulation of the\\n\\n30 present invention may be administered for therapy by any suitable route, including without limitation, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intradermal), intrathecal, and\\n\\n35 pulmonary. The preferred route will, of course, vary with the condition and age of the recipient, the particular syndrome being treated, and the specific combination of drugs employed.\\n\\nAn ibudilast composition of the invention, when compris-\\n\\n40 ing more than one active agent, may be administered as a single combination composition comprising a combination ofibudilast and at least one additional active agent effective in the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases. In terms of patient compliance and ease of administration, such\\n\\n45 an approach is preferred, since patients are often adverse to taking multiple pills or dosage forms, often multiple times daily, over the duration of treatment. Alternatively, albeit less preferably, the combination of the invention is administered as separate dosage forms. In instances in which the drugs\\n\\n50 comprising the therapeutic composition of the invention are administered as separate dosage forms and co-administration is required, ibudilast and each of the additional active agents may be administered simultaneously, sequentially in any order, or separately.\\n\\n55 Dosages\\n\\nTherapeutic amounts can be empirically determined and will vary with the particular condition being treated, the sub\\xad ject, and the efficacy and toxicity of each of the active agents contained in the composition. The actual dose to be adminis-\\n\\n60 tered will vary depending upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and particular combination being administered.\\n\\nTherapeutically effective amounts can be determined by\\n\\n65 those skilled in the art, and will be adjusted to the require\\xad ments of each particular case. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount of ibudilast will range from a total daily\\n\\n\\n\\ndosage of about 0.1 and 200 mg/day, more preferably, in an amount between 1-240 mg/day, 30-240 mg/day, 1-120 mg/day, 30-120 mg/day, administered as either a single dos- age or as multiple dosages. Preferred dosage amounts include dosages greater than about 10 mg BID or TID. That is to say, a preferred dosage amount is greater than about 20 mg/day or greater than 30 mg/day. Dosage amounts may be selected from 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 90 mg/day or 120 mg/day or more.

Buccafusco (Editor).\\n\\nFormulations of the Invention\\n\\nIn addition to comprising ibudilast, a therapeutic formula\\xad\\n\\n\\n\\ndition to be treated, administration can be one, two, or three 10 times daily for a time course of one day to several days, weeks, months, and even years, and may even be for the life\\n\\nof the patient. Illustrative dosing regimes will last a period of at least about a week, from about 1-4 weeks, from 1-3 months,\\n\\nfrom 1-6 months, from 1-52 weeks, from 1-24 months, or 15\\n\\nlonger.\\n\\nPractically speaking, a unit dose of any given composition of the invention or active agent can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules, depending on the judgment of the\\n\\nclinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific 20 dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limi\\xad tation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, every other day, three 25 times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and so forth.\\n\\nApproaches for Treatment of Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases\\n\\nIbudilast is a potent suppressor of glial activation (Mizuno 30 et al. (2004) Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411). In a dose\\xad dependent manner, ibudilast has been shown to suppress the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species, interleukin (IL)-1.beta., IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and enhance the production of the inhibitory cytokine, 35 IL-10, along with additional neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor (NGF), glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin (NT)-4 in activated microglia.\\n\\nThus, ibudilast-mediated-neuroprotection was found to be primarily due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and 40 the upregulation of neurotrophic factors.\\n\\nIbudilast crosses the blood-brain barrier when adminis\\xad tered systemically (Sugiyama et al. (1993) No To Shinkei 45(2):139-42; FIG. 5), thus eliminating the need for more invasive methods of administration in order to access central 45 sites of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nAs shown in Example 1, the inventors of the present inven\\xad tion made the surprising discovery in a human clinical trial that administration of ibudilast can reduce brain volume loss\\n\\n\\ntion of the invention may optionally contain one or more additional components as described below.\\n\\nExcipients/Carriers\\n\\nIn addition to ibudilast, the compositions of the invention for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases may fur\\xad ther comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydrogenated castor oil (HCO), cremophors, carbohydrates, starches (e.g., com starch), inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, binders/fillers, surfactants, lubricants (e.g., calcium or mag\\xad nesium stearate), glidants such as talc, disintegrants, diluents, buffers, acids, bases, film coats, combinations thereof, and the like.\\n\\nA composition of the invention may include one or more carbohydrates such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar poly\\xad mer. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glu\\xad cose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodex- trins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.\\n\\nAlso suitable for use in the compositions of the invention are potato and com-based starches such as sodium starch glycolate and directly compressible modified starch.\\n\\nFurther representative excipients include inorganic salt or buffers such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chlo\\xad ride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.\\n\\nAn ibudilast-containing composition of the invention may also include an antimicrobial agent, e.g., for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Non-limiting examples of anti\\xad microbial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alco\\xad hol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenyl\\xad ethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combi-\\n\\n\\n\\nin patients that are suffering from an affliction that causes brain volume to shrink. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the present inventors believe that ibudilast administered in accordance with the present claims will cause a slowing or reversal in the loss of brain volume due to the\\n\\n\\n50 nations thereof.\\n\\nA composition of the invention may also contain one or more antioxidants. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxida\\xad tion, thereby preventing the deterioration of the drug(s) or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants\\n\\n\\n\\natrophy and death of neurons in a progressive neurodegen- 55 erative disease that causes the brain to shrink; these changes can be tracked in cerebral MR or CT images. This discovery\\n\\nof the slowing or reversal of brain volume shrinkage has significant application in the treatment of progressive neuro\\xad\\n\\n\\nfor use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytolu- ene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gal\\xad late, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.\\n\\n\\n\\ndegenerative diseases described in this application. Animal Models\\n\\nThe ability of ibudilast to treat progressive neuropathic diseases can be evaluated by any of the standard progressive neuropathic disease models known in the art. Examples of such models are described in Animal Models ofNeurological Disease: Neurodegenerative Diseases (Neuromethods) by Alan A. Boulton, Glen B. Baker, and Roger F. Butterworth\\n\\n\\n60 Additional excipients include surfactants such as polysor- bates, e.g., \"Tween 20\" and \"Tween 80,\" and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, N.J.), sorbitan esters, lipids (e.g., phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, and phos-\\n\\n65 phatidylethanolamines), fatty acids and fatty esters, steroids such as cholesterol, and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther, a composition of the invention may optionally include one or more acids or bases. Non-limiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting ofhydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichlo\\xad roacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,\\n\\n\\nSustained Delivery Formulations\\n\\nPreferably, the compositions are formulated in order to improve stability and extend the half-life of ibudilast. For example, ibudilast may be delivered in a sustained-release\\n\\n5   formulation. Controlled or sustained-release formulations are\\n\\nprepared by incorporating ibudilast into a carrier or vehicle such as liposomes, nonresorbable impermeable polymers such as ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers and Hytrel® copolymers, swellable polymers such as hydrogels, or resorb\\xad\\n\\n\\n\\nsodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, 10 ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and\\n\\n\\nable polymers such as collagen and certain polyacids or poly\\xad esters such as those used to make resorbable sutures. Addi- tionally, ibudilast can be encapsulated, adsorbed to, or associated with, particulate carriers. Examples of particulate\\n\\n\\n\\ncombinations thereof.\\n\\nThe amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the role of the excipient, the dosage requirements of the active agent components, and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of\\n\\n\\n15 carriers include those derived from polymethyl methacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived from poly(lac\\xad\\n\\ntides) and poly(lactide-co-glycolides), known as PLG. See, e.g., Jeffery et al., Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368; and McGee et al., J. Microencap. (1996).\\n\\n\\n\\nany individual excipient is determined through routine 20 experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then deter\\xad mining the range at which optimal performance is attained\\n\\n\\nDelivery Forms\\n\\nThe ibudilast compositions described herein encompass all types of formulations, and in particular, those that are suited for systemic or intrathecal administration. Oral dosage forms include tablets, lozenges, capsules, syrups, oral suspensions,\\n\\n\\n\\nwith no significant adverse effects.\\n\\nGenerally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5% to about 98% by weight,\\n\\nmore preferably from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the\\n\\n\\n25 emulsions, granules, and pellets. Alternative formulations\\n\\ninclude aerosols, transdermal patches, gels, creams, oint\\xad ments, suppositories, powders or lyophilates that can be reconstituted, as well as liquids. Examples of suitable dilu- ents for reconstituting solid compositions, e.g., prior to injec\\xad\\n\\n\\n\\nexcipient. In general, the amount of excipient present in an 30 ibudilast composition of the invention is selected from the following: at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%,\\n\\n35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%,\\n\\n85%, 90%, or even 95% by weight.\\n\\n\\ntion, include bacteriostatic water for injection, dextrose 5% in water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer\\'s solution, saline, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations thereof. With respect to liquid pharmaceutical compositions, solu\\xad tions and suspensions are envisioned. Preferably, an ibudilast\\n\\n\\n\\nThese foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients are described in \"Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy\", 19th ed., Williams & Williams, (1995), the \"Physician\\'s Desk Reference\", 52.sup.nd ed.,\\n\\n\\n35 composition of the invention is one suited for oral adminis\\xad\\n\\ntration.\\n\\nIn turning now to oral delivery formulations, tablets can be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or additives.

Preferably, the active agent is one that possesses a mechanism of action different from that of ibudilast. Such actives include the combinations for pain listed in US Appli\\xad cation No. 20060160843, as well as the active ingredients recognized for treatment for the target diseases. Such active ingredients can be found listed in the FDA\\'s Orange Book, Goodman & Gilman The Pharmacological Basis of Thera\\xad peutics, J. Griffith Hardman, L. L. Limbird, A. Gilman, 11th Ed., 2005, The Merck Manual, 18th edition, 2007, and The Merck Manual of Medical Information 2003.\\n\\nThe dosage amounts provided above are meant to be merely guidelines; the precise amount of a secondary active\\n\\n\\n45 sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) and/or surface-active or dispersing agent.\\n\\nMolded tablets are made, for example, by molding in a suitable tabletting machine, a mixture of powdered com-\\n\\n50 pounds moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored, and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredi\\xad ents, using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile.\\n\\n55 Tablets may optionally be provided with a coating, such as a thin film, sugar coating, or an enteric coating to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. Processes, equipment, and toll manufacturers for tablet and capsule making are well-known in the art.\\n\\n\\n\\nagent to be administered during combination therapy with 60 ibudilast will, of course, be adjusted accordingly and will depend upon factors such as intended patient population, the particular progressive neuropathic disease symptom or con\\xad dition to be treated, potential synergies between the active agents administered, and the like, and will readily be deter- 65 mined by one skilled in the art based upon the guidance provided herein.\\n\\n\\nFormulations for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredients, generally in a flavored base such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active ingredients in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.\\n\\nA pharmaceutical composition for topical administration may also be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, paste, gel, spray, aerosol or oil.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, the formulation may be in the form of a patch (e.g., a transdermal patch) or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Topical formu\\xad lations may additionally include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the ingredients through the skin or other affected areas, such as dimethylsulfoxidem bisab\\xad olol, oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, and D-limonene, to name a few.\\n\\nFor emulsions, the oily phase is constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While this phase may com\\xad prise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with\\n\\na fat and/or an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is\\n\\n\\npolymer matrices, hydrogels, or covalent attachment of a polymer such as polyethylene glycol to the active agent.\\n\\nIn addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the invention may optionally\\n\\n5  include other agents conventional in the pharmaceutical arts\\n\\nand particular type of formulation being employed, for example, for oral administration forms, the composition for oral administration may also include additional agents as sweeteners, thickeners or flavoring agents\\n\\n10 Kits\\n\\nAlso provided herein is a kit containing at least one com\\xad bination composition of the invention, accompanied by instructions for use\\n\\nFor example, in instances in which each of the drugs them\\xad\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nincluded together with a lipophilic emulsifier that acts as a\\n\\nstabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabi\\xad lizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emul\\xad sifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of 20 cream formulations. Illustrative emulgents and emulsion sta\\xad bilizers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myri- styl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.\\n\\nFormulations for rectal administration are typically in the form of a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for 25 example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.\\n\\nFormulations suitable for vaginal administration generally take the form of a suppository, tampon, cream, gel, paste, foam or spray.\\n\\nFormulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein 30 the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns. Such a formulation is typically administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage, e.g., from a con\\xad tainer of the powder held in proximity to the nose. Alterna- 35 tively, a formulation for nasal delivery may be in the form of\\n\\na liquid, e.g., a nasal spray or nasal drops.\\n\\nAerosolizable formulations for inhalation may be in dry powder form (e.g., suitable for administration by a dry pow- der inhaler), or, alternatively, may be in liquid form, e.g., for 40 use in a nebulizer. Nebulizers for delivering an aerosolized solution include the AERx™ (Aradigm), the Ultravent® (Mallinkrodt), and the Acom II® (Marquest Medical Prod\\xad ucts). A composition of the invention may also be delivered using a pressurized, metered dose inhaler (MDI), e.g., the 45 Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, containing a solution or suspension of a combination of drugs as described herein in a pharmaceutically inert liquid propellant, e.g., a chlorofluoro\\xad carbon or fluorocarbon.\\n\\nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration 50 include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile solutions suitable for injection, as well as aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions.\\n\\nParenteral formulations of the invention are optionally contained in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for 55 example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze\\xad dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solu\\xad tions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, 60 granules and tablets of the types previously described.\\n\\nA formulation of the invention may also be a sustained release formulation, such that each of the drug components is released or absorbed slowly over time, when compared to a non-sustained release formulation. Sustained release formu- 65 lations may employ pro-drug forms of the active agent, delayed-release drug delivery systems such as liposomes or\\n\\n\\nselves are administered as individual or separate dosage forms, the kit comprises ibudilast in addition to each of the drugs making up the composition of the invention, along with instructions for use. The drug components may be packaged in any manner suitable for administration, so long as the packaging, when considered along with the instructions for administration, clearly indicates the manner in which each of the drug components is to be administered.\\n\\nFor example, for an illustrative kit comprising ibudilast and gabapentin, the kit may be organized by any appropriate time period, such as by day. As an example, for Day 1, a represen\\xad tative kit may comprise unit dosages of each of ibudilast and gabapentin. If each of the drugs is to be administered twice daily, then the kit may contain, corresponding to Day 1, two rows of unit dosage forms of each of ibudilast and gabapentin, along with instructions for the timing of administration. Alternatively, if one or more of the drugs differs in the timing or quantity of unit dosage form to be administered in com\\xad parison to the other drug members of the combination, then such would be reflected in the packaging and instructions. Various embodiments according to the above may be readily envisioned, and would of course depend upon the particular combination of drugs, in addition to ibudilast, employed for treatment, their corresponding dosage forms, recommended dosages, intended patient population, and the like. The pack\\xad aging may be in any form commonly employed for the pack\\xad aging of pharmaceuticals, and may utilize any of a number of features such as different colors, wrapping, tamper-resistant packaging, blister paks, dessicants, and the like.\\n\\nIt is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with preferred specific embodi\\xad ments, the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.\\n\\nAll references mentioned in this application, including any patents, published patent applications, books, handbooks, journal publications, or the FDA Orange Book are hereby incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety.\\n\\nEXAMPLES\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\n\\n\\nA Phase II placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was conducted using ibudilast in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Treatment with a 30 mg/day dosing regimen of MN-166 showed a trend toward reduced risk of new lesion evolution to persistent black holes compared to placebo (RR\\n\\n30 0.735, p=0.074). Of the 292 patients who received either placebo (n=l00), 30mg/dayofMN-166 (n=94) or60mg/day ofMN-166 (n=98), 72 of the placebo-treated patients, 64 of the patients receiving 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 56 of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tExample 3\\t35\\n\\nAn animal model for progressive multiple sclerosis is administered ibudilast and an improvement in functional out\\xad comes is achieved for the group of animals being adminis\\xad tered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be 40 effective for the treatment progressive multiple sclerosis.\\n\\nExample 4\\n\\nAn animal model for Parkinson\\'s disease is administered 45\\n\\nibudilast and an improvement in locomotion is achieved for the group of animals being administered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be effective for the treatment Parkinson\\'s disease.\\n\\n\\npatients receiving 60 mg/day ofMN-166 had new lesions in month two of the study. The proportions of new lesions evolv\\xad ing to persistent black holes were 0.24, 0.20 and 0.16 in the placebo, 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 60 mg/day ofMN-166 treatment groups, respectively. The relative risk (RR) for new lesion evolution to persistent black holes was significantly lower (RR 0.63, p=0.011) in MS patients treated with 60 mg/day of MN-166 and tended to be lower (RR 0.735, p=0.074) in patients treated with 30 mg/day of MN-166 com\\xad pared to placebo-treated patients.\\n\\nThe study is the result of randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled analysis of year 1 MRI data with MN-166 administration. MRis were collected bimonthly during the one year treatment period and were re-evaluated in a double\\xad blind manner for this new analysis. Predefined endpoints for\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 5\\n\\nTable 2 below show that disability progression (greater than or equal to a 1.0 point increase in the Expanded Disabil\\xad ity Status Scale (EDSS) score for 4 consecutive months, see Kurtzke J F (1983). \"Rating neurologic impairment in mul\\xad tiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS)\". Neurology 33 (11): 1444-52.) was less likely in those patients receiving MN-166 for 24 months than those receiving the drug for 12 months (p=0.026). The p-values at 24 Months were: 2Year Active (pooling of30 mg and 60 mg dose groups) vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0264); 60 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0516), and 30 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0832). Loss of brain volume on MRI has been shown to correlate with clinical progression and disability in MS patients. These results are consistent with a potential neuroprotective effect ofMN-166 in relapsing MS patients.\\n\\n\\n50 this evaluation were the rate of evolution of new lesions to persistent black holes and remyelinated lesions. The pre\\xad defined statistical endpoints were at the rate of evolution of new lesions (NL) to persistent black holes (PBH) and remy\\xad elinated lesions (RL). New Tl gadolinium-enhancing or new\\n\\n55 T2 lesions were defined as NL in the first on-study MRI at month 2. Lesions that were hypointense and inactive at month 10 were defined as PBH. Hypointense lesions at month 2 or 4 that were isointense at month 10 were RL. Relative Risk (RR) of NL evolution to PBH and RL per patient was analyzed\\n\\n60 using a general linear model with the error term from the Poisson distribution.\\n\\nOverall, the benefits to multiple sclerosis patents of extended (at least about two years) ibudilast administration include, but are not limited to, prolongation of time to relapse\\n\\n65 (by an average of about 130 days compared with untreated patients), lessened likelihood for sustained disability progres\\xad sion (a decrease in the rate by about 50% compared with\\n\\n\\n\\npatients treated for less than two years), reduction in brain volume loss, and reduction in conversion of acute lesions to persistent black holes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tReduction of Persistent Black Hole (PBH) Formation\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tTreatment Groups\\t\\n\\n\\t\\nThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered for at least two years.\\n\\n\\tThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar-\\n\\n5 maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered at least once daily.\\n\\n\\tThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered orally.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n30mg/\\n\\n60mg/\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\tParameter\\tPlacebo\\n\\nday\\n\\nday\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30mg/\\n\\n60mg/\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\tParameter\\tPlacebo\\n\\nday\\n\\nday\\n\\n\\n\\nThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of 30 mg to 240 mg daily.\\n\\n\\tThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of30 mg to 120 mg daily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n# Patients w.

In particu- lar, the present invention pertains to methods of treating or preventing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and their associated symptoms by administration ofibudilast (3-isobu\\xadcorticodentatinigral degeneration. Additional subjects can be suffering from progressive neurodegenerative disease that mainly afflicts young adults and children and include Haller\\xad vorden-Spatz disease and progressive familial myoclonic epi\\xad lepsy, progressive neurodegenerative disease that includestyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[l ,5-a]pyridine).BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe small molecule ibudilast (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropy\\xad lpyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridine) is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, lOAl and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006). Ibudilast also acts as a leukotriene D4 antagonist, an anti-inflamma\\xad tory, a PAF antagonist, and a vasodilatory agent (Thompson Current Drug Reports). Ibudilast is thought to exert a neuro\\xad protective role in the central nervous system of mammals, presumably via suppression of the activation of glial cells (Mizuno et al., Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411, 2004).Ibudilast has been widely used in Japan for relieving symp\\xad toms associated with ischemic stroke or bronchial asthma. In recent clinical trials, its use in the treatment of multiple scle\\xad rosis (MS), an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, has been explored (News.Medical.Net; Pharmaceu\\xad tical News, 2Aug. 2005).As disclosed in this publication, this clinical trial was expected to treat \"relapsing-remitting MS,\" however, no mention is made of progressive multiple sclero\\xad sis. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,747, ibudilast is disclosed as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, which is generally under\\xad stood to mean relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, not progressive multiple sclerosis. US Patent Application No. 20060160843 discloses ibudilast for the treatment of inter\\xad mittent and short term pain, however, this is not pain related to a progressive neurodegenerative disease.While the use of ibudilast for a number of varying indica\\xad tions has been reported to date, to the best of the applicants\\' knowledge, its use in treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases has heretofore remained largely unexplored.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a novel approach to treat\\xad ing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and is based upon the surprising discovery that progressive neurodegenerative diseases can be successfully treated or prevented by admin\\xad istration of ibudilast. Using standard progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases models, the inventors have discovered that the systemic administration of ibudilast is effective in25 syndromes of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and movement, or disease that includes paralysis agitans (Par\\xad kinson\\'s disease), striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclearpalsy, torsion dystonia (torsion spasm; dystonia musculorum deformans), spasmodic torticollis and other30 restricted dyskinesias, Familial tremor, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, syndromes of progressive ataxia, cerebel\\xad lar degenerations or spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebel\\xad lar cortical degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), spinocerebellar degenerations including spinocer-35 ebellar degenerations (Friedreich\\'s ataxia and related disor\\xadders). Other indications include central autonomic nervous system failure (Shy-Drager syndrome), syndromes of mus\\xad cular weakness and wasting without sensory changes (motor neuron disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal40 muscular atrophy, infantile spinal muscular atrophy (Werd\\xad nig-Hoffmann), juvenile spinal muscular atrophy (Wohlfart\\xad Kugelberg-Welander), or other forms of familial spinal mus\\xad cular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis or hereditary spastic paraplegia, syndromes combining muscular weakness and45 wasting with sensory changes (progressive neural muscular atrophy; chronic familial polyneuropathies), peroneal mus\\xad cular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), hypertrophic intersti\\xad tial polyneuropathy (Deferine-Sottas), or miscellaneous forms of chronic progressive neuropathy, progressive neuro-50 degenerative diseases that include syndromes of progressive visual loss. Other indications treatable with the present inven\\xad tion are pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pig\\xad mentosa), or hereditary optic atrophy (Leber\\'s disease), motor neuron disease and the progressive ataxias; sporadic55 progressive neurodegenerative diseases, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, motor neuropathy with paraproeinemia, motor-predominant peripheral neuropa\\xad thies, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Azorean (Machado-Jo\\xad seph) disease, familial progressive neurodegenerative dis-60 eases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, familial spastic paraparesis, hereditary biochemical disorders, arthrogryposis muliplex congenital, or progressive juvenile bulbar palsy (Fazio-Londe)-Ex\\xad amples of hereditary biochemical disorders are superoxide65 dismutase deficieny, hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, or androgen receptor mutation (Kennedy\\'s syndrome). Further\\xad more, progressive neurodegenerative diseases can includeviral and prion diseases, such as HTLV-1 associated myel\\xad opathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, kuru, fatal familial insomnia, or Alper\\'s disease.In one or more alternative embodiments of the method, ibudilast is administered at a daily dosage amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily, or from about 30 mg to 180 mg daily, 60 mg to 120 mg daily, or 20 to 80 mg daily.The therapeutic dosage amount may be achieved by admin\\xad istration once daily (i.e., in a single dose), twice daily (i.e., in two separate doses), three times daily, or may be administered as multiple doses over a time course of several days, weeks, or even months. Such administering is typically over a duration of time effective to result in a slowing (an inhibition) ortional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenera\\xad tive diseases, for simultaneous, sequential or separate use.Each of the herein-described features of the invention is meant to apply equally to each and every embodiment as5  described herein, unless otherwise indicated.Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part, will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following, or may be learned by practice of the10 invention.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1 shows the percent change in brain volume ofdimunition (a lessening), and ideally elimination or even 15 reversal, of a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Exem\\xad plary durations of treatment include at least about 1 month, from 1 to 3 months, up to about 6 months, up to about 12 months or even longer, such as 24 months or longer. In one particular embodiment, treatment lasts from about 1 week to 20 about 52 weeks.In a preferred embodiment of the treatment method, the administering is over a duration of time effective to result in elimination of the progressive neurodegenerative disease.patients in a Phase II clinical trial. Patients being adminis\\xad tered 60 mg a day ofibudilast had an average ofO.79% loss of brain volume, whereas patients being given a placebo had a brain volume loss of 1.2% over a I-year treatment period. This is a statistically significant result with a p value of 0.0352.FIG. 2 shows a significant reduction in brain volume loss (p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in MS patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo.Such a time can be a least one year, for at least 20 months orfor at least two years.In a specific embodiment of the invention, a method is described in which an effective amount of ibudilast is admin\\xad istered to patients suffering from a progressive form of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, who are at risk for conversion of their disease to secondary pro\\xad gressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), whereby the rate of con\\xad version from RRMS to SPMS is decreased by at least approximately half for such patients who are treated daily25 A similar effect was observed in the relapsing-remitting patients.FIG. 3 shows results from a clinical trial in which patients who received placebo during the first 12 months of the trial were randomized to receive either 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per30 day (double-blind maintained) during the second 12 months of the trial; patients who received 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per day during the first 12 months remained on the assigned dose for the second 12 months of the trial.-Theresults of the trial showed that the significant reduction in brain volume losswith an effective amount of ibudilast for a period of at least 35two years (compared, for example, to untreated patients or to patients treated daily for only one year). Thus, the present method includes a method of administering effective amounts of ibudilast to certain patient populations for at least abouttwo years, at least about three years, at least about four years, 40or at least about five years and perhaps longer.In yet another embodiment, ibudilast, when administered either singly or as part of a combination therapy, is adminis\\xad tered either systemically or centrally (e.g., by intrathecal administration, i.e., into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding 45 the spinal cord). Such administration of ibudilast provides a novel mechanism to attenuate progressive neurodegenerative diseases, potentially via suppression of glial activation.According to yet a further embodiment, ibudilast is admin\\xad istered systemically, e.g. via parenteral, enteral, oral, intrave- 50 nous, intranasal, sublingual or other systemic routes, to a human, subject for the treatment of progressive neurodegen\\xad erative diseases.In another aspect, the invention provides a composition or combination effective for treating progressive neurodegen- 55 erative diseases. The composition comprises a combinationof: (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, where each of the components is either contained in a single com\\xad position or dosage form (such as in an admixture), or is 60 present as a discrete or separate entity (e.g., in a kit).A composition of the invention may optionally include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.In yet another aspect, the invention encompasses a kit comprising a combination of medicaments for the treatment 65 of progressive neurodegenerative diseases or a related syn\\xad drome, comprising, (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one addi-(p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo (FIG. 2) was again demonstrated in Year 2 and was significantly less (p=0.030) in patients receiving 60 mg per day ofMN-166 for 24 months compared to the other treatment groups (placebo for 12 months, 30 mg MN-166 for 12 months; placebo for 12months, 60 mg MN-166 for 12 months; 30 mg for 24 months).DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of chemistry, bio\\xad chemistry, and pharmacology, within the skill of the art.

A progressive state is a worsening of symptoms over time. Generally, the symptoms worsen at a gradual rate.Examples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer\\'s Disease, Parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The term \"central nervous system\" or \"CNS\" includes all cells and tissue of the brain and spinal cord of a vertebrate. Thus, the term includes, but is not limited to, neuronal cells, glial cells, astrocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), interstitial spaces and the like.\"Glial cells\" refer to various cells of the CNS also known as microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.The terms \"subject\", \"individual\" or \"patient\" are usedinterchangeably herein and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a25 Examples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzhe\\xad imer\\'s disease, and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis exclusive ofrelapse/remitting multiple sclerosis.There are four recognized types of multiple sclerosis: (1)30 Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclero\\xad sis), (2) Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP mul\\xad tiple sclerosis), (3) Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis), and (4) Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple sclerosis). RR multiple sclerosis is not35 considered to fall within the scope of the claims, but the other forms of multiple sclerosis, i.e. SP multiple sclerosis, PR multiple sclerosis and PP multiple sclerosis are considered to be one aspect of the present invention. In all types of progres\\xad sive MS, there is a loss of function over time regardless of40 relapses.\"Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclerosis)\" is characterized by relapses (also known as exac\\xad erbations) during which time new symptoms can appear and old ones resurface or worsen. The relapses are followed by45 periods of remission, during which time the person fully or partially recovers from the deficits acquired during the relapse. Relapses can last for days, weeks or months and recovery can be slow and gradual or almost instantaneous. The vast majority of people presenting with Multiple Sclero-50 sis are first diagnosed with relapsing/remitting. This is typi\\xad cally when they are in their twenties or thirties, though diag\\xad noses much earlier or later are known. Around twice as many women as men present with this variety.In \"Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP multiple 55 sclerosis),\" a person who initially had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis begins to develop a gradual deterioration in nerve function, with or without relapses. After a number of years many people who have had relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis will pass into a secondary progressive phase of the60 disease. This is characterized by a gradual worsening of the disease between relapses. In the early phases of Secondary Progressive, the person may still experience a few relapses but after a while these merge into a general progression. People often do not return to their prior level of function after65 a relapse. People with secondary progressive may experience good and bad days or weeks, but, apart from some remission following relapsing episodes, have no real recovery. After 10years, 50% of people with relapsing/remitting multiple scle\\xad rosis will have developed secondary progressive. By 25 to 30 years, that figure will have risen to 90%.\"Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis)\" shows clear progression in the level of disability 5 from the time symptoms first begin, but with episodes of clear relapses that may or may not be associated with some recov- ery following the acute episode. This form of multiple scle\\xad rosis follows a progressive course from onset, punctuated by relapses. There is significant recovery immediately following 10 a relapse but between relapses there is a gradual worsening of symptoms.\"Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple scle\\xadsolvates, and the like, as appropriate for use in its intended formulation for administration.Ibudilast is a is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, 10Al and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006), and has also been reported to have leukotriene D4 and PAF antagonistic activi- ties. Its profile appears effectively anti-inflammatory and unique in comparison to other PDE inhibitors and anti-in\\xad flanimatory agents. PDEs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phos\\xad phoester bond on the 3\\'-carbon to yield the corresponding 5\\'-nucleotide monophosphate. Thus, they regulate the cellu- lar concentrations of cyclic nucleotides. Since extracellular receptors for many hormones and neurotransmitters utilize cyclic nucleotides as second messengers, the PDEs also regu-rosis)\" is characterized by a gradual progression of the dis\\xadease from its onset with no remissions or relapses at all. There may be periods of a leveling off of disease activity and, as with secondary progressive, there may be good and bad days or weeks. PP multiple sclerosis differs from Relapsing/Re\\xad mitting and Secondary Progressive in that onset is typically in the late thirties or early forties, men are as likely women to develop it and initial disease activity is in the spinal cord and not in the brain. Primary Progressive multiple sclerosis often migrates into the brain, but is less likely to damage brain areas than relapsing/remitting or secondary progressive-for example, people with Primary Progressive are less likely to develop cognitive problems.\"Treatment\" or \"treating\" progressive neurodegenerative diseases includes arresting the development or reversing the symptom of a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\"Persistent neuronal or axon damage\" includes damage to neurons that is long term or permanent, such as when neurons die and disappear.\"Persistent black hole\" is defined as a hypointense lesion. Black holes, or dark areas on a Tl weighted magnetic reso\\xad nance imaging (MRI) scan, show loss of myelin and loss of axons. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, a Tl weighted scan uses longitudinal relaxation time a short relaxation time (TR) and short echo time (TE) (TR<l000 msec, TE<30 msec).IbudilastThe methods of the invention for the treatment of progres\\xad sive neurodegenerative diseases are based upon administra\\xad tion of the molecule, ibudilast. Ibudilast is a small molecule drug (molecular weight of230.3) having the structure shown below.Ibudilast is also found under ChemBank ID 3227, CAS #50847-11-5, and Beilstein Handbook Reference No. 5-24- 03-00396. Its molecular formula corresponds to C14H18N20. Ibudilast is also known by various chemical names including2-methyl-1-(2-(1-methylethyl) pyrazolo(l ,5-a)pyridin-3-yl) 1-propanone; 3-isobutyry1-2-isopropylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyri\\xad dine]; and 1-(2-isopropyl-pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-2- methyl-propan-1-one. Other synonyms for ibudilast include Ibudilastum (Latin), BRN 0656579, KC-404, and MN-166. Its brand name is Ketas®. Ibudilast, as referred to herein, is meant to include any and all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, prodrug forms (e.g., the corresponding ketal),15 late cellular responses to these extracellular signals. There are at least eight classes of PDEs: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PDEs (PDE!); cGMP-stimulated PDEs (PDE2); cGMP-in\\xad hibited PDEs (PDE3); cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4); cGMP\\xad binding PDEs (PDE5); photoreceptor PDEs (PDE6); high20 affinity, cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE7); and high affinity cGMP-specific PDEs (PDE9). Ibudilast acts to suppress inflammation via action on inflanimatory cells (e.g., glial cells) resulting in the suppression of both pro-inflammatory mediator and neuroactive mediator release. Ibudilast may25 also suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 \\' TNF-a) and may enhance the production of the anti\\xad inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10).

Such administering is effective to decrease the amount of progressive neurodegen\\xad erative disease experienced by the subject, i.e., to result in a significant attenuation or even reversal of progressive neuro\\xad degenerative disease, as demonstrated in the accompanying60 Examples. Ibudilast is preferably administered at a daily dos\\xad age amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily, or from about 30 mg to 180 mg daily, or 60 mg to 120 mg daily. The method of the invention may, in certain instances, comprise a step of selecting a subject experiencing progres-65 sive neurodegenerative diseases prior to administering ibudi\\xad last thereto. Such subjects are typically selected from those suffering from: Alzheimer\\'s disease, Senile dementia of theAlzheimer type, or Pick\\'s disease (lobar atrophy), syndromes combining progressive dementia with other prominent neu\\xad rologic abnormalities, Huntington\\'s disease, multiple system atrophy combining dementia with ataxia and/or manifesta\\xad tion of Parkinson\\'s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski), diffuse Lewy body disease, or corticodentatinigral degeneration, Hallervorden-Spatz dis\\xad ease and progressive familial myoclonic epilepsy, symptoms of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and move\\xad ment, paralysis agitans (Parkinson\\'s disease), striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, torsion dysto\\xad nia (torsion spasm; dystonia musculorum deformans), spas\\xad modic torticollis and other restricted dyskinesias, Familial tremor, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, progressive ataxia, cerebellar degenerations or spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebellar cortical degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atro\\xad phy (OPCA), spinocerebellar degenerations (Friedreich\\'s ataxia and related disorders), central autonomic nervous sys\\xad tem failure (Shy-Drager syndrome), syndromes of muscular weakness and wasting without sensory changes (motor neu\\xad ron disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy, infantile spinal muscular atrophy (Werd\\xad nig-Hoffmann), juvenile spinal muscular atrophy (Wohlfart\\xad Kugelberg-Welander), or other forms offamilial spinal mus\\xad cular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, or hereditary spastic paraplegia, syndromes combining muscular weakness and wasting with sensory changes (progressive neural muscular atrophy; chronic familial polyneuropathies), peroneal mus\\xad cular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), hypertrophic intersti\\xad tial polyneuropathy (Deferine-Sottas), or miscellaneous forms of chronic progressive neuropathy, syndromes of pro\\xad gressive visual loss, pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pigmentosa), or hereditary optic atrophy (Leber\\'s disease), Parkinson\\'s disease and other extrapyramidal disor\\xad ders, progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson\\xad Olszewski syndrome), torsion dystonia (torsion spasm, dys\\xad tonia musculorum deformans), focal dystonias, Familial tremors, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, motor neuron disease and the progressive ataxias, amyotrophic lateral scle\\xad rosis, primary lateral sclerosis, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, motor neuropathy with paraproeine\\xad mia, motor-predominant peripheral neuropathies, olivopon\\xad tocerebellar atrophy, Azorean (Machado-Joseph) disease, familial progressive neurodegenerative diseases, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, familial spastic paraparesis, hereditary biochemical disor\\xad ders, arthrogryposis muliplex congenital, or progressive juve\\xad nile bulbarpalsy (Fazio-Lande), infantile (Werdnig-Hoffman disease), childhood onset, or adolescent (Wohlfart-Kugel\\xad berg-Welander disease), familial HTLV-1 myelopathy, iso\\xad lated FSP, or complicated FSP, superoxide dismutase defi\\xad ciency, hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, or androgen receptor mutation (Kennedy\\'s syndrome), viral and prion diseases, myelopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencepha\\xad lopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler\\xad Scheinker disease, knru, fatal familial insonmia, or Alper\\'s disease, includes primary progressive or secondary progres\\xad sive multiple sclerosis, but excludes relapsing, remitting mul\\xad tiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Wilson\\'s disease, progressive neuropathic pain. In some embodiments of this invention, administering to treat patients with multiple scle\\xad rosis is excluded.Ibudilast may also be administered in combination with an additional agent effective for treating progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases. In a preferred embodiment, such agent possesses a mechanism of action different from ibudilast. Exemplary agents include cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g.,Razadyne® (formerly known as Reminyl®) (galantamine), Exelon® (rivastigmine),Aricept® (donepezil), and Cognex® (tacrine)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitors (e.g., Namenda® (memantine)), levodopa preparations (e.g.,5 levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet® or Atamet®), levodopa/ benserazide (Madopar®), levodopa/carbiopa (Sinemet CR®), levodopa/benserazide (Madopar HBS®), carbidopa/ levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo®)), catechol-O-methyl trans\\xad ferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entacapone (Comtan®), tol-10 capone (Tasmar®)), dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine (Parlodel®), pergolide (Permax®), pramipexole (Mirapex®), ropinirole (Requip®), cabergoline (Dostinex®), apomorphine (Apokyn®), lisuride (Dopergine®)), immunomodulating drugs (e.g., interferon15 beta-la (Avonex®, Rebif®), interferon beta-lb (Betase\\xad ron®), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®), natalizumab (Tysa\\xad bri®)), immunosuppressant/chemotherapy drugs (e.g, mitox\\xad antrone (Novantrone®), azathioprine (Imuran®), cladribine (Leustatin®), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®), cyclosporine-20 A, methotrexate), oral medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (fingolimod (FTY720), BG12, laquinimod, teriflunomide), etc.Preferred methods of delivery of ibudilast-based therapeu\\xad tic formulations for the treatment of progressive neuropathic25 diseases include systemic and localized delivery. Such routes of administration include but are not limited to, oral, intra\\xad arterial, intrathecal, intraspinal, intramuscular, intraperito\\xad neal, intranasal, and inhalation routes.More particularly, an ibudilast-based formulation of the30 present invention may be administered for therapy by any suitable route, including without limitation, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intradermal), intrathecal, and35 pulmonary. The preferred route will, of course, vary with the condition and age of the recipient, the particular syndrome being treated, and the specific combination of drugs employed.An ibudilast composition of the invention, when compris-40 ing more than one active agent, may be administered as a single combination composition comprising a combination ofibudilast and at least one additional active agent effective in the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases. In terms of patient compliance and ease of administration, such45 an approach is preferred, since patients are often adverse to taking multiple pills or dosage forms, often multiple times daily, over the duration of treatment. Alternatively, albeit less preferably, the combination of the invention is administered as separate dosage forms. In instances in which the drugs50 comprising the therapeutic composition of the invention are administered as separate dosage forms and co-administration is required, ibudilast and each of the additional active agents may be administered simultaneously, sequentially in any order, or separately.55 DosagesTherapeutic amounts can be empirically determined and will vary with the particular condition being treated, the sub\\xad ject, and the efficacy and toxicity of each of the active agents contained in the composition. The actual dose to be adminis-60 tered will vary depending upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and particular combination being administered.Therapeutically effective amounts can be determined by65 those skilled in the art, and will be adjusted to the require\\xad ments of each particular case. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount of ibudilast will range from a total dailydosage of about 0.1 and 200 mg/day, more preferably, in an amount between 1-240 mg/day, 30-240 mg/day, 1-120 mg/day, 30-120 mg/day, administered as either a single dos- age or as multiple dosages. Preferred dosage amounts include dosages greater than about 10 mg BID or TID. That is to say, a preferred dosage amount is greater than about 20 mg/day or greater than 30 mg/day. Dosage amounts may be selected from 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 90 mg/day or 120 mg/day or more. Depending upon the dosage amount and precise con\\xad(1992); Handbook of Laboratory Animal Science, Second Edition: Volumes I-III (Handbook of Laboratory Animal Sci\\xad ence) by Jann Hau (Editor), Jr., Gerald L.

Buccafusco (Editor).Formulations of the InventionIn addition to comprising ibudilast, a therapeutic formula\\xaddition to be treated, administration can be one, two, or three 10 times daily for a time course of one day to several days, weeks, months, and even years, and may even be for the lifeof the patient. Illustrative dosing regimes will last a period of at least about a week, from about 1-4 weeks, from 1-3 months,from 1-6 months, from 1-52 weeks, from 1-24 months, or 15longer.Practically speaking, a unit dose of any given composition of the invention or active agent can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules, depending on the judgment of theclinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific 20 dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limi\\xad tation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, every other day, three 25 times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and so forth.Approaches for Treatment of Progressive Neurodegenerative DiseasesIbudilast is a potent suppressor of glial activation (Mizuno 30 et al. (2004) Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411). In a dose\\xad dependent manner, ibudilast has been shown to suppress the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species, interleukin (IL)-1.beta., IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and enhance the production of the inhibitory cytokine, 35 IL-10, along with additional neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor (NGF), glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin (NT)-4 in activated microglia.Thus, ibudilast-mediated-neuroprotection was found to be primarily due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and 40 the upregulation of neurotrophic factors.Ibudilast crosses the blood-brain barrier when adminis\\xad tered systemically (Sugiyama et al. (1993) No To Shinkei 45(2):139-42; FIG. 5), thus eliminating the need for more invasive methods of administration in order to access central 45 sites of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.As shown in Example 1, the inventors of the present inven\\xad tion made the surprising discovery in a human clinical trial that administration of ibudilast can reduce brain volume losstion of the invention may optionally contain one or more additional components as described below.Excipients/CarriersIn addition to ibudilast, the compositions of the invention for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases may fur\\xad ther comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydrogenated castor oil (HCO), cremophors, carbohydrates, starches (e.g., com starch), inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, binders/fillers, surfactants, lubricants (e.g., calcium or mag\\xad nesium stearate), glidants such as talc, disintegrants, diluents, buffers, acids, bases, film coats, combinations thereof, and the like.A composition of the invention may include one or more carbohydrates such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar poly\\xad mer. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glu\\xad cose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodex- trins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.Also suitable for use in the compositions of the invention are potato and com-based starches such as sodium starch glycolate and directly compressible modified starch.Further representative excipients include inorganic salt or buffers such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chlo\\xad ride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.An ibudilast-containing composition of the invention may also include an antimicrobial agent, e.g., for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Non-limiting examples of anti\\xad microbial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alco\\xad hol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenyl\\xad ethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combi-in patients that are suffering from an affliction that causes brain volume to shrink. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the present inventors believe that ibudilast administered in accordance with the present claims will cause a slowing or reversal in the loss of brain volume due to the50 nations thereof.A composition of the invention may also contain one or more antioxidants. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxida\\xad tion, thereby preventing the deterioration of the drug(s) or other components of the preparation.

Animal ModelsThe ability of ibudilast to treat progressive neuropathic diseases can be evaluated by any of the standard progressive neuropathic disease models known in the art. Examples of such models are described in Animal Models ofNeurological Disease: Neurodegenerative Diseases (Neuromethods) by Alan A. Boulton, Glen B. Baker, and Roger F. Butterworth60 Additional excipients include surfactants such as polysor- bates, e.g., \"Tween 20\" and \"Tween 80,\" and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, N.J.), sorbitan esters, lipids (e.g., phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, and phos-65 phatidylethanolamines), fatty acids and fatty esters, steroids such as cholesterol, and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.Further, a composition of the invention may optionally include one or more acids or bases. Non-limiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting ofhydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichlo\\xad roacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,Sustained Delivery FormulationsPreferably, the compositions are formulated in order to improve stability and extend the half-life of ibudilast. For example, ibudilast may be delivered in a sustained-release5   formulation. Controlled or sustained-release formulations areprepared by incorporating ibudilast into a carrier or vehicle such as liposomes, nonresorbable impermeable polymers such as ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers and Hytrel® copolymers, swellable polymers such as hydrogels, or resorb\\xadsodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, 10 ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, andable polymers such as collagen and certain polyacids or poly\\xad esters such as those used to make resorbable sutures. Addi- tionally, ibudilast can be encapsulated, adsorbed to, or associated with, particulate carriers. Examples of particulatecombinations thereof.The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the role of the excipient, the dosage requirements of the active agent components, and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of15 carriers include those derived from polymethyl methacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived from poly(lac\\xadtides) and poly(lactide-co-glycolides), known as PLG. See, e.g., Jeffery et al., Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368; and McGee et al., J. Microencap. (1996).any individual excipient is determined through routine 20 experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then deter\\xad mining the range at which optimal performance is attainedDelivery FormsThe ibudilast compositions described herein encompass all types of formulations, and in particular, those that are suited for systemic or intrathecal administration. Oral dosage forms include tablets, lozenges, capsules, syrups, oral suspensions,with no significant adverse effects.Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5% to about 98% by weight,more preferably from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the25 emulsions, granules, and pellets.

Examples of suitable dilu- ents for reconstituting solid compositions, e.g., prior to injec\\xadexcipient. In general, the amount of excipient present in an 30 ibudilast composition of the invention is selected from the following: at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%,35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%,85%, 90%, or even 95% by weight.tion, include bacteriostatic water for injection, dextrose 5% in water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer\\'s solution, saline, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations thereof. With respect to liquid pharmaceutical compositions, solu\\xad tions and suspensions are envisioned.

Preferably, the active agent is one that possesses a mechanism of action different from that of ibudilast. Such actives include the combinations for pain listed in US Appli\\xad cation No. 20060160843, as well as the active ingredients recognized for treatment for the target diseases. Such active ingredients can be found listed in the FDA\\'s Orange Book, Goodman & Gilman The Pharmacological Basis of Thera\\xad peutics, J. Griffith Hardman, L. L. Limbird, A.

The tablets may optionally be coated or scored, and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredi\\xad ents, using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile.55 Tablets may optionally be provided with a coating, such as a thin film, sugar coating, or an enteric coating to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. Processes, equipment, and toll manufacturers for tablet and capsule making are well-known in the art.agent to be administered during combination therapy with 60 ibudilast will, of course, be adjusted accordingly and will depend upon factors such as intended patient population, the particular progressive neuropathic disease symptom or con\\xad dition to be treated, potential synergies between the active agents administered, and the like, and will readily be deter- 65 mined by one skilled in the art based upon the guidance provided herein.Formulations for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredients, generally in a flavored base such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active ingredients in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.A pharmaceutical composition for topical administration may also be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, paste, gel, spray, aerosol or oil.Alternatively, the formulation may be in the form of a patch (e.g., a transdermal patch) or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Topical formu\\xad lations may additionally include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the ingredients through the skin or other affected areas, such as dimethylsulfoxidem bisab\\xad olol, oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, and D-limonene, to name a few.For emulsions, the oily phase is constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While this phase may com\\xad prise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier witha fat and/or an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier ispolymer matrices, hydrogels, or covalent attachment of a polymer such as polyethylene glycol to the active agent.In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the invention may optionally5  include other agents conventional in the pharmaceutical artsand particular type of formulation being employed, for example, for oral administration forms, the composition for oral administration may also include additional agents as sweeteners, thickeners or flavoring agents10 KitsAlso provided herein is a kit containing at least one com\\xad bination composition of the invention, accompanied by instructions for useFor example, in instances in which each of the drugs them\\xad15included together with a lipophilic emulsifier that acts as astabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabi\\xad lizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emul\\xad sifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of 20 cream formulations. Illustrative emulgents and emulsion sta\\xad bilizers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myri- styl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.Formulations for rectal administration are typically in the form of a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for 25 example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.Formulations suitable for vaginal administration generally take the form of a suppository, tampon, cream, gel, paste, foam or spray.Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein 30 the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns. Such a formulation is typically administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage, e.g., from a con\\xad tainer of the powder held in proximity to the nose. Alterna- 35 tively, a formulation for nasal delivery may be in the form ofa liquid, e.g., a nasal spray or nasal drops.Aerosolizable formulations for inhalation may be in dry powder form (e.g., suitable for administration by a dry pow- der inhaler), or, alternatively, may be in liquid form, e.g., for 40 use in a nebulizer. Nebulizers for delivering an aerosolized solution include the AERx™ (Aradigm), the Ultravent® (Mallinkrodt), and the Acom II® (Marquest Medical Prod\\xad ucts). A composition of the invention may also be delivered using a pressurized, metered dose inhaler (MDI), e.g., the 45 Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, containing a solution or suspension of a combination of drugs as described herein in a pharmaceutically inert liquid propellant, e.g., a chlorofluoro\\xad carbon or fluorocarbon.Formulations suitable for parenteral administration 50 include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile solutions suitable for injection, as well as aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions.Parenteral formulations of the invention are optionally contained in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for 55 example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze\\xad dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solu\\xad tions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, 60 granules and tablets of the types previously described.A formulation of the invention may also be a sustained release formulation, such that each of the drug components is released or absorbed slowly over time, when compared to a non-sustained release formulation. Sustained release formu- 65 lations may employ pro-drug forms of the active agent, delayed-release drug delivery systems such as liposomes orselves are administered as individual or separate dosage forms, the kit comprises ibudilast in addition to each of the drugs making up the composition of the invention, along with instructions for use. The drug components may be packaged in any manner suitable for administration, so long as the packaging, when considered along with the instructions for administration, clearly indicates the manner in which each of the drug components is to be administered.For example, for an illustrative kit comprising ibudilast and gabapentin, the kit may be organized by any appropriate time period, such as by day. As an example, for Day 1, a represen\\xad tative kit may comprise unit dosages of each of ibudilast and gabapentin. If each of the drugs is to be administered twice daily, then the kit may contain, corresponding to Day 1, two rows of unit dosage forms of each of ibudilast and gabapentin, along with instructions for the timing of administration. Alternatively, if one or more of the drugs differs in the timing or quantity of unit dosage form to be administered in com\\xad parison to the other drug members of the combination, then such would be reflected in the packaging and instructions. Various embodiments according to the above may be readily envisioned, and would of course depend upon the particular combination of drugs, in addition to ibudilast, employed for treatment, their corresponding dosage forms, recommended dosages, intended patient population, and the like. The pack\\xad aging may be in any form commonly employed for the pack\\xad aging of pharmaceuticals, and may utilize any of a number of features such as different colors, wrapping, tamper-resistant packaging, blister paks, dessicants, and the like.It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with preferred specific embodi\\xad ments, the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.All references mentioned in this application, including any patents, published patent applications, books, handbooks, journal publications, or the FDA Orange Book are hereby incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety.EXAMPLESExample 1A Phase II placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was conducted using ibudilast in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Of the 292 patients who received either placebo (n=l00), 30mg/dayofMN-166 (n=94) or60mg/day ofMN-166 (n=98), 72 of the placebo-treated patients, 64 of the patients receiving 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 56 of theExample 335An animal model for progressive multiple sclerosis is administered ibudilast and an improvement in functional out\\xad comes is achieved for the group of animals being adminis\\xad tered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be 40 effective for the treatment progressive multiple sclerosis.Example 4An animal model for Parkinson\\'s disease is administered 45ibudilast and an improvement in locomotion is achieved for the group of animals being administered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be effective for the treatment Parkinson\\'s disease.patients receiving 60 mg/day ofMN-166 had new lesions in month two of the study. The proportions of new lesions evolv\\xad ing to persistent black holes were 0.24, 0.20 and 0.16 in the placebo, 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 60 mg/day ofMN-166 treatment groups, respectively. The relative risk (RR) for new lesion evolution to persistent black holes was significantly lower (RR 0.63, p=0.011) in MS patients treated with 60 mg/day of MN-166 and tended to be lower (RR 0.735, p=0.074) in patients treated with 30 mg/day of MN-166 com\\xad pared to placebo-treated patients.The study is the result of randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled analysis of year 1 MRI data with MN-166 administration. MRis were collected bimonthly during the one year treatment period and were re-evaluated in a double\\xad blind manner for this new analysis. Predefined endpoints forExample 5Table 2 below show that disability progression (greater than or equal to a 1.0 point increase in the Expanded Disabil\\xad ity Status Scale (EDSS) score for 4 consecutive months, see Kurtzke J F (1983). \"Rating neurologic impairment in mul\\xad tiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS)\". Neurology 33 (11): 1444-52.) was less likely in those patients receiving MN-166 for 24 months than those receiving the drug for 12 months (p=0.026). The p-values at 24 Months were: 2Year Active (pooling of30 mg and 60 mg dose groups) vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0264); 60 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0516), and 30 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0832). Loss of brain volume on MRI has been shown to correlate with clinical progression and disability in MS patients. These results are consistent with a potential neuroprotective effect ofMN-166 in relapsing MS patients.50 this evaluation were the rate of evolution of new lesions to persistent black holes and remyelinated lesions. The pre\\xad defined statistical endpoints were at the rate of evolution of new lesions (NL) to persistent black holes (PBH) and remy\\xad elinated lesions (RL). New Tl gadolinium-enhancing or new55 T2 lesions were defined as NL in the first on-study MRI at month 2. Lesions that were hypointense and inactive at month 10 were defined as PBH. Hypointense lesions at month 2 or 4 that were isointense at month 10 were RL. Relative Risk (RR) of NL evolution to PBH and RL per patient was analyzed60 using a general linear model with the error term from the Poisson distribution.Overall, the benefits to multiple sclerosis patents of extended (at least about two years) ibudilast administration include, but are not limited to, prolongation of time to relapse65 (by an average of about 130 days compared with untreated patients), lessened likelihood for sustained disability progres\\xad sion (a decrease in the rate by about 50% compared withpatients treated for less than two years), reduction in brain volume loss, and reduction in conversion of acute lesions to persistent black holes.TABLE3Reduction of Persistent Black Hole (PBH) FormationTreatment GroupsThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered for at least two years.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar-5 maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered at least once daily.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered orally.30mg/60mg/10ParameterPlacebodayday30mg/60mg/10ParameterPlacebodaydayThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of 30 mg to 240 mg daily.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of30 mg to 120 mg daily.# Patients w.

       " 'lly to methods for 20 treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases. In particu- lar, the present invention pertains to methods of treating or preventing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and their associated symptoms by administration ofibudilast (3-isobu\\xadcorticodentatinigral degeneration. Additional subjects can be suffering from progressive neurodegenerative disease that mainly afflicts young adults and children and include Haller\\xad vorden-Spatz disease and progressive familial myoclonic epi\\xad lepsy, progressive neurodegenerative disease that includestyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[l ,5-a]pyridine).BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe small molecule ibudilast (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropy\\xad lpyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridine) is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, lOAl and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006). Ibudilast also acts as a leukotriene D4 antagonist, an anti-inflamma\\xad tory, a PAF antagonist, and a vasodilatory agent (Thompson Current Drug Reports). Ibudilast is thought to exert a neuro\\xad protective role in the central nervous system of mammals, presumably via suppression of the activation of glial cells (Mizuno et al., Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411, 2004).Ibudilast has been widely used in Japan for relieving symp\\xad toms associated with ischemic stroke or bronchial asthma. In recent clinical trials, its use in the treatment of multiple scle\\xad rosis (MS), an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, has been explored (News.Medical.Net; Pharmaceu\\xad tical News, 2Aug. 2005).As disclosed in this publication, this clinical trial was expected to treat \"relapsing-remitting MS,\" however, no mention is made of progressive multiple sclero\\xad sis. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,747, ibudilast is disclosed as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, which is generally under\\xad stood to mean relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, not progressive multiple sclerosis. US Patent Application No. 20060160843 discloses ibudilast for the treatment of inter\\xad mittent and short term pain, however, this is not pain related to a progressive neurodegenerative disease.While the use of ibudilast for a number of varying indica\\xad tions has been reported to date, to the best of the applicants\\' knowledge, its use in treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases has heretofore remained largely unexplored.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a novel approach to treat\\xad ing progressive neurodegenerative diseases and is based upon the surprising discovery that progressive neurodegenerative diseases can be successfully treated or prevented by admin\\xad istration of ibudilast. Using standard progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases models, the inventors have discovered that the systemic administration of ibudilast is effective in25 syndromes of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and movement, or disease that includes paralysis agitans (Par\\xad kinson\\'s disease), striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclearpalsy, torsion dystonia (torsion spasm; dystonia musculorum deformans), spasmodic torticollis and other30 restricted dyskinesias, Familial tremor, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, syndromes of progressive ataxia, cerebel\\xad lar degenerations or spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebel\\xad lar cortical degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), spinocerebellar degenerations including spinocer-35 ebellar degenerations (Friedreich\\'s ataxia and related disor\\xadders). Other indications include central autonomic nervous system failure (Shy-Drager syndrome), syndromes of mus\\xad cular weakness and wasting without sensory changes (motor neuron disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal40 muscular atrophy, infantile spinal muscular atrophy (Werd\\xad nig-Hoffmann), juvenile spinal muscular atrophy (Wohlfart\\xad Kugelberg-Welander), or other forms of familial spinal mus\\xad cular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis or hereditary spastic paraplegia, syndromes combining muscular weakness and45 wasting with sensory changes (progressive neural muscular atrophy; chronic familial polyneuropathies), peroneal mus\\xad cular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), hypertrophic intersti\\xad tial polyneuropathy (Deferine-Sottas), or miscellaneous forms of chronic progressive neuropathy, progressive neuro-50 degenerative diseases that include syndromes of progressive visual loss. Other indications treatable with the present inven\\xad tion are pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pig\\xad mentosa), or hereditary optic atrophy (Leber\\'s disease), motor neuron disease and the progressive ataxias; sporadic55 progressive neurodegenerative diseases, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, motor neuropathy with paraproeinemia, motor-predominant peripheral neuropa\\xad thies, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Azorean (Machado-Jo\\xad seph) disease, familial progressive neurodegenerative dis-60 eases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, familial spastic paraparesis, hereditary biochemical disorders, arthrogryposis muliplex congenital, or progressive juvenile bulbar palsy (Fazio-Londe)-Ex\\xad amples of hereditary biochemical disorders are superoxide65 dismutase deficieny, hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, or androgen receptor mutation (Kennedy\\'s syndrome). Further\\xad more, progressive neurodegenerative diseases can includeviral and prion diseases, such as HTLV-1 associated myel\\xad opathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, kuru, fatal familial insomnia, or Alper\\'s disease.In one or more alternative embodiments of the method, ibudilast is administered at a daily dosage amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily, or from about 30 mg to 180 mg daily, 60 mg to 120 mg daily, or 20 to 80 mg daily.The therapeutic dosage amount may be achieved by admin\\xad istration once daily (i.e., in a single dose), twice daily (i.e., in two separate doses), three times daily, or may be administered as multiple doses over a time course of several days, weeks, or even months. Such administering is typically over a duration of time effective to result in a slowing (an inhibition) ortional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenera\\xad tive diseases, for simultaneous, sequential or separate use.Each of the herein-described features of the invention is meant to apply equally to each and every embodiment as5  described herein, unless otherwise indicated.Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part, will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following, or may be learned by practice of the10 invention.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1 shows the percent change in brain volume ofdimunition (a lessening), and ideally elimination or even 15 reversal, of a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Exem\\xad plary durations of treatment include at least about 1 month, from 1 to 3 months, up to about 6 months, up to about 12 months or even longer, such as 24 months or longer. In one particular embodiment, treatment lasts from about 1 week to 20 about 52 weeks.In a preferred embodiment of the treatment method, the administering is over a duration of time effective to result in elimination of the progressive neurodegenerative disease.patients in a Phase II clinical trial. Patients being adminis\\xad tered 60 mg a day ofibudilast had an average ofO.79% loss of brain volume, whereas patients being given a placebo had a brain volume loss of 1.2% over a I-year treatment period. This is a statistically significant result with a p value of 0.0352.FIG. 2 shows a significant reduction in brain volume loss (p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in MS patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo.Such a time can be a least one year, for at least 20 months orfor at least two years.In a specific embodiment of the invention, a method is described in which an effective amount of ibudilast is admin\\xad istered to patients suffering from a progressive form of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, who are at risk for conversion of their disease to secondary pro\\xad gressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), whereby the rate of con\\xad version from RRMS to SPMS is decreased by at least approximately half for such patients who are treated daily25 A similar effect was observed in the relapsing-remitting patients.FIG. 3 shows results from a clinical trial in which patients who received placebo during the first 12 months of the trial were randomized to receive either 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per30 day (double-blind maintained) during the second 12 months of the trial; patients who received 30 or 60 mg ofMN-166 per day during the first 12 months remained on the assigned dose for the second 12 months of the trial.-Theresults of the trial showed that the significant reduction in brain volume losswith an effective amount of ibudilast for a period of at least 35two years (compared, for example, to untreated patients or to patients treated daily for only one year). Thus, the present method includes a method of administering effective amounts of ibudilast to certain patient populations for at least abouttwo years, at least about three years, at least about four years, 40or at least about five years and perhaps longer.In yet another embodiment, ibudilast, when administered either singly or as part of a combination therapy, is adminis\\xad tered either systemically or centrally (e.g., by intrathecal administration, i.e., into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding 45 the spinal cord). Such administration of ibudilast provides a novel mechanism to attenuate progressive neurodegenerative diseases, potentially via suppression of glial activation.According to yet a further embodiment, ibudilast is admin\\xad istered systemically, e.g. via parenteral, enteral, oral, intrave- 50 nous, intranasal, sublingual or other systemic routes, to a human, subject for the treatment of progressive neurodegen\\xad erative diseases.In another aspect, the invention provides a composition or combination effective for treating progressive neurodegen- 55 erative diseases. The composition comprises a combinationof: (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, where each of the components is either contained in a single com\\xad position or dosage form (such as in an admixture), or is 60 present as a discrete or separate entity (e.g., in a kit).A composition of the invention may optionally include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.In yet another aspect, the invention encompasses a kit comprising a combination of medicaments for the treatment 65 of progressive neurodegenerative diseases or a related syn\\xad drome, comprising, (i) ibudilast, and (ii) at least one addi-(p=0.04), as measured by cranial magnetic resonance imag\\xad ing (MRI) scans, observed after 12 months in patients treated with 60 mg per day ofMN-166 compared to placebo (FIG. 2) was again demonstrated in Year 2 and was significantly less (p=0.030) in patients receiving 60 mg per day ofMN-166 for 24 months compared to the other treatment groups (placebo for 12 months, 30 mg MN-166 for 12 months; placebo for 12months, 60 mg MN-166 for 12 months; 30 mg for 24 months).DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of chemistry, bio\\xad chemistry, and pharmacology, within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g.; A. L.

A progressive state is a worsening of symptoms over time. Generally, the symptoms worsen at a gradual rate.Examples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer\\'s Disease, Parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The term \"central nervous system\" or \"CNS\" includes all cells and tissue of the brain and spinal cord of a vertebrate. Thus, the term includes, but is not limited to, neuronal cells, glial cells, astrocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), interstitial spaces and the like.\"Glial cells\" refer to various cells of the CNS also known as microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.The terms \"subject\", \"individual\" or \"patient\" are usedinterchangeably herein and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a25 Examples of progressive neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzhe\\xad imer\\'s disease, and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis exclusive ofrelapse/remitting multiple sclerosis.There are four recognized types of multiple sclerosis: (1)30 Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclero\\xad sis), (2) Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP mul\\xad tiple sclerosis), (3) Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis), and (4) Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple sclerosis). RR multiple sclerosis is not35 considered to fall within the scope of the claims, but the other forms of multiple sclerosis, i.e. SP multiple sclerosis, PR multiple sclerosis and PP multiple sclerosis are considered to be one aspect of the present invention. In all types of progres\\xad sive MS, there is a loss of function over time regardless of40 relapses.\"Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RR multiple sclerosis)\" is characterized by relapses (also known as exac\\xad erbations) during which time new symptoms can appear and old ones resurface or worsen. The relapses are followed by45 periods of remission, during which time the person fully or partially recovers from the deficits acquired during the relapse. Relapses can last for days, weeks or months and recovery can be slow and gradual or almost instantaneous. The vast majority of people presenting with Multiple Sclero-50 sis are first diagnosed with relapsing/remitting. This is typi\\xad cally when they are in their twenties or thirties, though diag\\xad noses much earlier or later are known. Around twice as many women as men present with this variety.In \"Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SP multiple 55 sclerosis),\" a person who initially had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis begins to develop a gradual deterioration in nerve function, with or without relapses. After a number of years many people who have had relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis will pass into a secondary progressive phase of the60 disease. This is characterized by a gradual worsening of the disease between relapses. In the early phases of Secondary Progressive, the person may still experience a few relapses but after a while these merge into a general progression. People often do not return to their prior level of function after65 a relapse. People with secondary progressive may experience good and bad days or weeks, but, apart from some remission following relapsing episodes, have no real recovery. After 10years, 50% of people with relapsing/remitting multiple scle\\xad rosis will have developed secondary progressive. By 25 to 30 years, that figure will have risen to 90%.\"Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PR multiple sclerosis)\" shows clear progression in the level of disability 5 from the time symptoms first begin, but with episodes of clear relapses that may or may not be associated with some recov- ery following the acute episode. This form of multiple scle\\xad rosis follows a progressive course from onset, punctuated by relapses. There is significant recovery immediately following 10 a relapse but between relapses there is a gradual worsening of symptoms.\"Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PP multiple scle\\xadsolvates, and the like, as appropriate for use in its intended formulation for administration.Ibudilast is a is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3A, 4, 10Al and 1lAl (Gibson et al., Eur J Pharmacol 538: 39-42, 2006), and has also been reported to have leukotriene D4 and PAF antagonistic activi- ties. Its profile appears effectively anti-inflammatory and unique in comparison to other PDE inhibitors and anti-in\\xad flanimatory agents. PDEs catalyze the hydrolysis of the phos\\xad phoester bond on the 3\\'-carbon to yield the corresponding 5\\'-nucleotide monophosphate. Thus, they regulate the cellu- lar concentrations of cyclic nucleotides. Since extracellular receptors for many hormones and neurotransmitters utilize cyclic nucleotides as second messengers, the PDEs also regu-rosis)\" is characterized by a gradual progression of the dis\\xadease from its onset with no remissions or relapses at all. There may be periods of a leveling off of disease activity and, as with secondary progressive, there may be good and bad days or weeks. PP multiple sclerosis differs from Relapsing/Re\\xad mitting and Secondary Progressive in that onset is typically in the late thirties or early forties, men are as likely women to develop it and initial disease activity is in the spinal cord and not in the brain. Primary Progressive multiple sclerosis often migrates into the brain, but is less likely to damage brain areas than relapsing/remitting or secondary progressive-for example, people with Primary Progressive are less likely to develop cognitive problems.\"Treatment\" or \"treating\" progressive neurodegenerative diseases includes arresting the development or reversing the symptom of a progressive neurodegenerative disease.\"Persistent neuronal or axon damage\" includes damage to neurons that is long term or permanent, such as when neurons die and disappear.\"Persistent black hole\" is defined as a hypointense lesion. Black holes, or dark areas on a Tl weighted magnetic reso\\xad nance imaging (MRI) scan, show loss of myelin and loss of axons. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, a Tl weighted scan uses longitudinal relaxation time a short relaxation time (TR) and short echo time (TE) (TR<l000 msec, TE<30 msec).IbudilastThe methods of the invention for the treatment of progres\\xad sive neurodegenerative diseases are based upon administra\\xad tion of the molecule, ibudilast. Ibudilast is a small molecule drug (molecular weight of230.3) having the structure shown below.Ibudilast is also found under ChemBank ID 3227, CAS #50847-11-5, and Beilstein Handbook Reference No. 5-24- 03-00396. Its molecular formula corresponds to C14H18N20. Ibudilast is also known by various chemical names including2-methyl-1-(2-(1-methylethyl) pyrazolo(l ,5-a)pyridin-3-yl) 1-propanone; 3-isobutyry1-2-isopropylpyrazolo(1,5-a)pyri\\xad dine]; and 1-(2-isopropyl-pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-2- methyl-propan-1-one. Other synonyms for ibudilast include Ibudilastum (Latin), BRN 0656579, KC-404, and MN-166. Its brand name is Ketas®. Ibudilast, as referred to herein, is meant to include any and all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof, prodrug forms (e.g., the corresponding ketal),15 late cellular responses to these extracellular signals. There are at least eight classes of PDEs: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PDEs (PDE!); cGMP-stimulated PDEs (PDE2); cGMP-in\\xad hibited PDEs (PDE3); cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4); cGMP\\xad binding PDEs (PDE5); photoreceptor PDEs (PDE6); high20 affinity, cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE7); and high affinity cGMP-specific PDEs (PDE9). Ibudilast acts to suppress inflammation via action on inflanimatory cells (e.g., glial cells) resulting in the suppression of both pro-inflammatory mediator and neuroactive mediator release. Ibudilast may25 also suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 \\' TNF-a) and may enhance the production of the anti\\xad inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10).

Such administering is effective to decrease the amount of pro',\n",
       " \"gressive neurodegen\\xad erative disease experienced by the subject, i.e., to result in a significant attenuation or even reversal of progressive neuro\\xad degenerative disease, as demonstrated in the accompanying60 Examples. Ibudilast is preferably administered at a daily dos\\xad age amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily, or from about 30 mg to 180 mg daily, or 60 mg to 120 mg daily. The method of the invention may, in certain instances, comprise a step of selecting a subject experiencing progres-65 sive neurodegenerative diseases prior to administering ibudi\\xad last thereto. Such subjects are typically selected from those suffering from: Alzheimer's disease, Senile dementia of theAlzheimer type, or Pick's disease (lobar atrophy), syndromes combining progressive dementia with other prominent neu\\xad rologic abnormalities, Huntington's disease, multiple system atrophy combining dementia with ataxia and/or manifesta\\xad tion of Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski), diffuse Lewy body disease, or corticodentatinigral degeneration, Hallervorden-Spatz dis\\xad ease and progressive familial myoclonic epilepsy, symptoms of gradually developing abnormalities of posture and move\\xad ment, paralysis agitans (Parkinson's disease), striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, torsion dysto\\xad nia (torsion spasm; dystonia musculorum deformans), spas\\xad modic torticollis and other restricted dyskinesias, Familial tremor, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, progressive ataxia, cerebellar degenerations or spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebellar cortical degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atro\\xad phy (OPCA), spinocerebellar degenerations (Friedreich's ataxia and related disorders), central autonomic nervous sys\\xad tem failure (Shy-Drager syndrome), syndromes of muscular weakness and wasting without sensory changes (motor neu\\xad ron disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy, infantile spinal muscular atrophy (Werd\\xad nig-Hoffmann), juvenile spinal muscular atrophy (Wohlfart\\xad Kugelberg-Welander), or other forms offamilial spinal mus\\xad cular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, or hereditary spastic paraplegia, syndromes combining muscular weakness and wasting with sensory changes (progressive neural muscular atrophy; chronic familial polyneuropathies), peroneal mus\\xad cular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth), hypertrophic intersti\\xad tial polyneuropathy (Deferine-Sottas), or miscellaneous forms of chronic progressive neuropathy, syndromes of pro\\xad gressive visual loss, pigmentary degeneration of the retina (retinitis pigmentosa), or hereditary optic atrophy (Leber's disease), Parkinson's disease and other extrapyramidal disor\\xad ders, progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson\\xad Olszewski syndrome), torsion dystonia (torsion spasm, dys\\xad tonia musculorum deformans), focal dystonias, Familial tremors, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, motor neuron disease and the progressive ataxias, amyotrophic lateral scle\\xad rosis, primary lateral sclerosis, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, motor neuropathy with paraproeine\\xad mia, motor-predominant peripheral neuropathies, olivopon\\xad tocerebellar atrophy, Azorean (Machado-Joseph) disease, familial progressive neurodegenerative diseases, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophies, familial spastic paraparesis, hereditary biochemical disor\\xad ders, arthrogryposis muliplex congenital, or progressive juve\\xad nile bulbarpalsy (Fazio-Lande), infantile (Werdnig-Hoffman disease), childhood onset, or adolescent (Wohlfart-Kugel\\xad berg-Welander disease), familial HTLV-1 myelopathy, iso\\xad lated FSP, or complicated FSP, superoxide dismutase defi\\xad ciency, hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, or androgen receptor mutation (Kennedy's syndrome), viral and prion diseases, myelopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencepha\\xad lopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler\\xad Scheinker disease, knru, fatal familial insonmia, or Alper's disease, includes primary progressive or secondary progres\\xad sive multiple sclerosis, but excludes relapsing, remitting mul\\xad tiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Wilson's disease, progressive neuropathic pain. In some embodiments of this invention, administering to treat patients with multiple scle\\xad rosis is excluded.Ibudilast may also be administered in combination with an additional agent effective for treating progressive neurode\\xad generative diseases. In a preferred embodiment, such agent possesses a mechanism of action different from ibudilast. Exemplary agents include cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g.,Razadyne® (formerly known as Reminyl®) (galantamine), Exelon® (rivastigmine),Aricept® (donepezil), and Cognex® (tacrine)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitors (e.g., Namenda® (memantine)), levodopa preparations (e.g.,5 levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet® or Atamet®), levodopa/ benserazide (Madopar®), levodopa/carbiopa (Sinemet CR®), levodopa/benserazide (Madopar HBS®), carbidopa/ levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo®)), catechol-O-methyl trans\\xad ferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entacapone (Comtan®), tol-10 capone (Tasmar®)), dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine (Parlodel®), pergolide (Permax®), pramipexole (Mirapex®), ropinirole (Requip®), cabergoline (Dostinex®), apomorphine (Apokyn®), lisuride (Dopergine®)), immunomodulating drugs (e.g., interferon15 beta-la (Avonex®, Rebif®), interferon beta-lb (Betase\\xad ron®), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®), natalizumab (Tysa\\xad bri®)), immunosuppressant/chemotherapy drugs (e.g, mitox\\xad antrone (Novantrone®), azathioprine (Imuran®), cladribine (Leustatin®), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®), cyclosporine-20 A, methotrexate), oral medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (fingolimod (FTY720), BG12, laquinimod, teriflunomide), etc.Preferred methods of delivery of ibudilast-based therapeu\\xad tic formulations for the treatment of progressive neuropathic25 diseases include systemic and localized delivery. Such routes of administration include but are not limited to, oral, intra\\xad arterial, intrathecal, intraspinal, intramuscular, intraperito\\xad neal, intranasal, and inhalation routes.More particularly, an ibudilast-based formulation of the30 present invention may be administered for therapy by any suitable route, including without limitation, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intradermal), intrathecal, and35 pulmonary. The preferred route will, of course, vary with the condition and age of the recipient, the particular syndrome being treated, and the specific combination of drugs employed.An ibudilast composition of the invention, when compris-40 ing more than one active agent, may be administered as a single combination composition comprising a combination ofibudilast and at least one additional active agent effective in the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases. In terms of patient compliance and ease of administration, such45 an approach is preferred, since patients are often adverse to taking multiple pills or dosage forms, often multiple times daily, over the duration of treatment. Alternatively, albeit less preferably, the combination of the invention is administered as separate dosage forms. In instances in which the drugs50 comprising the therapeutic composition of the invention are administered as separate dosage forms and co-administration is required, ibudilast and each of the additional active agents may be administered simultaneously, sequentially in any order, or separately.55 DosagesTherapeutic amounts can be empirically determined and will vary with the particular condition being treated, the sub\\xad ject, and the efficacy and toxicity of each of the active agents contained in the composition. The actual dose to be adminis-60 tered will vary depending upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and particular combination being administered.Therapeutically effective amounts can be determined by65 those skilled in the art, and will be adjusted to the require\\xad ments of each particular case. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount of ibudilast will range from a total dailydosage of about 0.1 and 200 mg/day, more preferably, in an amount between 1-240 mg/day, 30-240 mg/day, 1-120 mg/day, 30-120 mg/day, administered as either a single dos- age or as multiple dosages. Preferred dosage amounts include dosages greater than about 10 mg BID or TID. That is to say, a preferred dosage amount is greater than about 20 mg/day or greater than 30 mg/day. Dosage amounts may be selected from 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 90 mg/day or 120 mg/day or more. Depending upon the dosage amount and precise con\\xad(1992); Handbook of Laboratory Animal Science, Second Edition: Volumes I-III (Handbook of Laboratory Animal Sci\\xad ence) by Jann Hau (Editor), Jr., Gerald L.

Buccafusco (Editor).Formulations of the InventionIn addition to comprising ibudilast, a therapeutic formula\\xaddition to be treated, administration can be one, two, or three 10 times daily for a time course of one day to several days, weeks, months, and even years, and may even be for the lifeof the patient. Illustrative dosing regimes will last a period of at least about a week, from about 1-4 weeks, from 1-3 months,from 1-6 months, from 1-52 weeks, from 1-24 months, or 15longer.Practically speaking, a unit dose of any given composition of the invention or active agent can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules, depending on the judgment of theclinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific 20 dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limi\\xad tation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, every other day, three 25 times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and so forth.Approaches for Treatment of Progressive Neurodegenerative DiseasesIbudilast is a potent suppressor of glial activation (Mizuno 30 et al. (2004) Neuropharmacology 46: 404-411). In a dose\\xad dependent manner, ibudilast has been shown to suppress the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species, interleukin (IL)-1.beta., IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and enhance the production of the inhibitory cytokine, 35 IL-10, along with additional neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor (NGF), glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin (NT)-4 in activated microglia.Thus, ibudilast-mediated-neuroprotection was found to be primarily due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and 40 the upregulation of neurotrophic factors.Ibudilast crosses the blood-brain barrier when adminis\\xad tered systemically (Sugiyama et al. (1993) No To Shinkei 45(2):139-42; FIG. 5), thus eliminating the need for more invasive methods of administration in order to access central 45 sites of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.As shown in Example 1, the inventors of the present inven\\xad tion made the surprising discovery in a human clinical trial that administration of ibudilast can reduce brain volume losstion of the invention may optionally contain one or more additional components as described below.Excipients/CarriersIn addition to ibudilast, the compositions of the invention for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases may fur\\xad ther comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Exemplary excipients include, without limitation, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydrogenated castor oil (HCO), cremophors, carbohydrates, starches (e.g., com starch), inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, binders/fillers, surfactants, lubricants (e.g., calcium or mag\\xad nesium stearate), glidants such as talc, disintegrants, diluents, buffers, acids, bases, film coats, combinations thereof, and the like.A composition of the invention may include one or more carbohydrates such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar poly\\xad mer. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glu\\xad cose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodex- trins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.Also suitable for use in the compositions of the invention are potato and com-based starches such as sodium starch glycolate and directly compressible modified starch.Further representative excipients include inorgan\",\n",
       " 'ic salt or buffers such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chlo\\xad ride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.An ibudilast-containing composition of the invention may also include an antimicrobial agent, e.g., for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Non-limiting examples of anti\\xad microbial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alco\\xad hol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenyl\\xad ethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combi-in patients that are suffering from an affliction that causes brain volume to shrink. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the present inventors believe that ibudilast administered in accordance with the present claims will cause a slowing or reversal in the loss of brain volume due to the50 nations thereof.A composition of the invention may also contain one or more antioxidants. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxida\\xad tion, thereby preventing the deterioration of the drug(s) or other components of the preparation.

Animal ModelsThe ability of ibudilast to treat progressive neuropathic diseases can be evaluated by any of the standard progressive neuropathic disease models known in the art. Examples of such models are described in Animal Models ofNeurological Disease: Neurodegenerative Diseases (Neuromethods) by Alan A. Boulton, Glen B. Baker, and Roger F. Butterworth60 Additional excipients include surfactants such as polysor- bates, e.g., \"Tween 20\" and \"Tween 80,\" and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, N.J.), sorbitan esters, lipids (e.g., phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, and phos-65 phatidylethanolamines), fatty acids and fatty esters, steroids such as cholesterol, and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.Further, a composition of the invention may optionally include one or more acids or bases. Non-limiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting ofhydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichlo\\xad roacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,Sustained Delivery FormulationsPreferably, the compositions are formulated in order to improve stability and extend the half-life of ibudilast. For example, ibudilast may be delivered in a sustained-release5   formulation. Controlled or sustained-release formulations areprepared by incorporating ibudilast into a carrier or vehicle such as liposomes, nonresorbable impermeable polymers such as ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers and Hytrel® copolymers, swellable polymers such as hydrogels, or resorb\\xadsodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, 10 ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, andable polymers such as collagen and certain polyacids or poly\\xad esters such as those used to make resorbable sutures. Addi- tionally, ibudilast can be encapsulated, adsorbed to, or associated with, particulate carriers. Examples of particulatecombinations thereof.The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the role of the excipient, the dosage requirements of the active agent components, and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of15 carriers include those derived from polymethyl methacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived from poly(lac\\xadtides) and poly(lactide-co-glycolides), known as PLG.

(1996).any individual excipient is determined through routine 20 experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then deter\\xad mining the range at which optimal performance is attainedDelivery FormsThe ibudilast compositions described herein encompass all types of formulations, and in particular, those that are suited for systemic or intrathecal administration. Oral dosage forms include tablets, lozenges, capsules, syrups, oral suspensions,with no significant adverse effects.Generally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5% to about 98% by weight,more preferably from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the25 emulsions, granules, and pellets.

Examples of suitable dilu- ents for reconstituting solid compositions, e.g., prior to injec\\xadexcipient. In general, the amount of excipient present in an 30 ibudilast composition of the invention is selected from the following: at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%,35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%,85%, 90%, or even 95% by weight.tion, include bacteriostatic water for injection, dextrose 5% in water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer\\'s solution, saline, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations thereof.

Preferably, the active agent is one that possesses a mechanism of action different from that of ibudilast. Such actives include the combinations for pain listed in US Appli\\xad cation No. 20060160843, as well as the active ingredients recognized for treatment for the target diseases.

Topical formu\\xad lations may additionally include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the ingredients through the skin or other affected areas, such as dimethylsulfoxidem bisab\\xad olol, oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, and D-limonene, to name a few.For emulsions, the oily phase is constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While this phase may com\\xad prise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier witha fat and/or an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier ispolymer matrices, hydrogels, or covalent attachment of a polymer such as polyethylene glycol to the active agent.In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the invention may optionally5  include other agents conventional in the pharmaceutical artsand particular type of formulation being employed, for example, for oral administration forms, the composition for oral administration may also include additional agents as sweeteners, thickeners or flavoring agents10 KitsAlso provided herein is a kit containing at least one com\\xad bination composition of the invention, accompanied by instructions for useFor example, in instances in which each of the drugs them\\xad15included together with a lipophilic emulsifier that acts as astabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabi\\xad lizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emul\\xad sifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of 20 cream formulations. Illustrative emulgents and emulsion sta\\xad bilizers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myri- styl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.Formulations for rectal administration are typically in the form of a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for 25 example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.Formulations suitable for vaginal administration generally take the form of a suppository, tampon, cream, gel, paste, foam or spray.Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein 30 the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns. Such a formulation is typically administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage, e.g., from a con\\xad tainer of the powder held in proximity to the nose. Alterna- 35 tively, a formulation for nasal delivery may be in the form ofa liquid, e.g., a nasal spray or nasal drops.Aerosolizable formulations for inhalation may be in dry powder form (e.g., suitable for administration by a dry pow- der inhaler), or, alternatively, may be in liquid form, e.g., for 40 use in a nebulizer. Nebulizers for delivering an aerosolized solution include the AERx™ (Aradigm), the Ultravent® (Mallinkrodt), and the Acom II® (Marquest Medical Prod\\xad ucts). A composition of the invention may also be delivered using a pressurized, metered dose inhaler (MDI), e.g., the 45 Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, co',\n",

Extemporaneous injection solu\\xad tions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, 60 granules and tablets of the types previously described.A formulation of the invention may also be a sustained release formulation, such that each of the drug components is released or absorbed slowly over time, when compared to a non-sustained release formulation. Sustained release formu- 65 lations may employ pro-drug forms of the active agent, delayed-release drug delivery systems such as liposomes orselves are administered as individual or separate dosage forms, the kit comprises ibudilast in addition to each of the drugs making up the composition of the invention, along with instructions for use. The drug components may be packaged in any manner suitable for administration, so long as the packaging, when considered along with the instructions for administration, clearly indicates the manner in which each of the drug components is to be administered.For example, for an illustrative kit comprising ibudilast and gabapentin, the kit may be organized by any appropriate time period, such as by day. As an example, for Day 1, a represen\\xad tative kit may comprise unit dosages of each of ibudilast and gabapentin. If each of the drugs is to be administered twice daily, then the kit may contain, corresponding to Day 1, two rows of unit dosage forms of each of ibudilast and gabapentin, along with instructions for the timing of administration. Alternatively, if one or more of the drugs differs in the timing or quantity of unit dosage form to be administered in com\\xad parison to the other drug members of the combination, then such would be reflected in the packaging and instructions. Various embodiments according to the above may be readily envisioned, and would of course depend upon the particular combination of drugs, in addition to ibudilast, employed for treatment, their corresponding dosage forms, recommended dosages, intended patient population, and the like. The pack\\xad aging may be in any form commonly employed for the pack\\xad aging of pharmaceuticals, and may utilize any of a number of features such as different colors, wrapping, tamper-resistant packaging, blister paks, dessicants, and the like.It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with preferred specific embodi\\xad ments, the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.All references mentioned in this application, including any patents, published patent applications, books, handbooks, journal publications, or the FDA Orange Book are hereby incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety.EXAMPLESExample 1A Phase II placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was conducted using ibudilast in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Treatment with a 30 mg/day dosing regimen of MN-166 showed a trend toward reduced risk of new lesion evolution to persistent black holes compared to placebo (RR30 0.735, p=0.074). Of the 292 patients who received either placebo (n=l00), 30mg/dayofMN-166 (n=94) or60mg/day ofMN-166 (n=98), 72 of the placebo-treated patients, 64 of the patients receiving 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 56 of theExample 335An animal model for progressive multiple sclerosis is administered ibudilast and an improvement in functional out\\xad comes is achieved for the group of animals being adminis\\xad tered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be 40 effective for the treatment progressive multiple sclerosis.Example 4An animal model for Parkinson\\'s disease is administered 45ibudilast and an improvement in locomotion is achieved for the group of animals being administered ibudilast, thereby indicating that this model could be effective for the treatment Parkinson\\'s disease.patients receiving 60 mg/day ofMN-166 had new lesions in month two of the study. The proportions of new lesions evolv\\xad ing to persistent black holes were 0.24, 0.20 and 0.16 in the placebo, 30 mg/day ofMN-166 and 60 mg/day ofMN-166 treatment groups, respectively. The relative risk (RR) for new lesion evolution to persistent black holes was significantly lower (RR 0.63, p=0.011) in MS patients treated with 60 mg/day of MN-166 and tended to be lower (RR 0.735, p=0.074) in patients treated with 30 mg/day of MN-166 com\\xad pared to placebo-treated patients.The study is the result of randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled analysis of year 1 MRI data with MN-166 administration. MRis were collected bimonthly during the one year treatment period and were re-evaluated in a double\\xad blind manner for this new analysis. Predefined endpoints forExample 5Table 2 below show that disability progression (greater than or equal to a 1.0 point increase in the Expanded Disabil\\xad ity Status Scale (EDSS) score for 4 consecutive months, see Kurtzke J F (1983). \"Rating neurologic impairment in mul\\xad tiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS)\". Neurology 33 (11): 1444-52.) was less likely in those patients receiving MN-166 for 24 months than those receiving the drug for 12 months (p=0.026). The p-values at 24 Months were: 2Year Active (pooling of30 mg and 60 mg dose groups) vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0264); 60 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0516), and 30 mg vs. Placebo to Active (p=0.0832). Loss of brain volume on MRI has been shown to correlate with clinical progression and disability in MS patients. These results are consistent with a potential neuroprotective effect ofMN-166 in relapsing MS patients.50 this evaluation were the rate of evolution of new lesions to persistent black holes and remyelinated lesions. The pre\\xad defined statistical endpoints were at the rate of evolution of new lesions (NL) to persistent black holes (PBH) and remy\\xad elinated lesions (RL). New Tl gadolinium-enhancing or new55 T2 lesions were defined as NL in the first on-study MRI at month 2. Lesions that were hypointense and inactive at month 10 were defined as PBH. Hypointense lesions at month 2 or 4 that were isointense at month 10 were RL. Relative Risk (RR) of NL evolution to PBH and RL per patient was analyzed60 using a general linear model with the error term from the Poisson distribution.Overall, the benefits to multiple sclerosis patents of extended (at least about two years) ibudilast administration include, but are not limited to, prolongation of time to relapse65 (by an average of about 130 days compared with untreated patients), lessened likelihood for sustained disability progres\\xad sion (a decrease in the rate by about 50% compared withpatients treated for less than two years), reduction in brain volume loss, and reduction in conversion of acute lesions to persistent black holes.TABLE3Reduction of Persistent Black Hole (PBH) FormationTreatment GroupsThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered for at least two years.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar-5 maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered at least once daily.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered orally.30mg/60mg/10ParameterPlacebodayday30mg/60mg/10ParameterPlacebodaydayThe method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of 30 mg to 240 mg daily.The method of claim 1 in which the ibudilast or phar\\xad maceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in an amount of30 mg to 120 mg daily.# Patients w.

      "The patent US 9314452 B2 refers to compositions and methods for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, and their associated symptoms by administration of ibudilast (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[l,5-a]pyridine). The patent is a continuation of several previous applications and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/929,745, filed 11 Jul. 2007, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/042,181, filed 3 Apr. 2008. The patent was filed by MediciNova, Inc., and the inventors are Michael E. Kalafer, Kenneth W. Locke, Kazuko Matsuda, and Richard E. Gammans. The patent was granted on April 19, 2016. The patent does not provide a detailed description of the invention, background, or claims.The patent describes methods for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, by administering ibudilast, a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. The invention is based on the discovery that ibudilast can successfully treat or prevent progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The patent also describes a composition or combination effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, which includes ibudilast and at least one additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The patent also includes a kit comprising a combination of medicaments for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases or a related syndrome, comprising ibudilast and at least one additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The patent claims that ibudilast can be administered in a daily dosage amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily. The patent also includes results from clinical trials showing the effectiveness of ibudilast in treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases.The patent describes a method for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, using the molecule ibudilast. The molecule is a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and has anti-inflammatory properties. The patent claims that the administration of ibudilast can decrease the amount of progressive neurodegenerative disease in a patient. The patent also provides definitions for various terms used in the patent, such as \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier\", \"pharmacologically effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\", \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\", \"active molecule\" or \"active agent\", and \"progressive neurodegenerative disease\". The patent also describes the different types of multiple sclerosis and how they are characterized. The patent also provides information on the structure and properties of ibudilast, as well as its method of administration.The patent discusses a method for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases using ibudilast, a potent suppressor of glial activation. The method is shown to result in a significant attenuation or even reversal of progressive neurodegenerative disease. The diseases that can be treated include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ibudilast is preferably administered at a daily dosage amount ranging from about 30 mg to 240 mg daily. The method may also include a step of selecting a subject experiencing progressive neurodegenerative diseases prior to administering ibudilast. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ibudilast may also be administered in combination with an additional agent effective for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Such agents include cholinesterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitors, levodopa preparations, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, dopamine agonists, immunomodulating drugs, immunosuppressant/chemotherapy drugs, and oral medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also discusses the delivery methods of ibudilast-based therapeutic formulations, which include systemic and localized delivery. Such routes of administration include oral, intra-arterial, intrathecal, intraspinal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, and inhalation routes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also discusses the formulation of the invention, which in addition to ibudilast, may contain one or more additional components such as excipients or carriers. These include polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydrogenated castor oil (HCO), cremophors, carbohydrates, starches, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, binders/fillers, surfactants, lubricants, glidants, disintegrants, diluents, buffers, acids, bases, film coats, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also discusses the dosage of ibudilast, which can be empirically determined and will vary with the particular condition being treated, the subject, and the efficacy and toxicity of each of the active agents contained in the composition. The actual dose to be administered will vary depending upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated.The patent discusses a composition containing ibudilast, a drug used to treat progressive neurodegenerative diseases that cause the brain to shrink. The inventors believe that ibudilast can slow or reverse the loss of brain volume. The composition may also include an antimicrobial agent, antioxidants, and other excipients such as surfactants, lipids, fatty acids and esters, steroids, and chelating agents. \n",
      "\n",
      "The composition can be formulated for various types of administration, including oral, intrathecal, topical, nasal, and inhalation. It can be delivered in various forms such as tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensions, emulsions, granules, pellets, aerosols, transdermal patches, gels, creams, ointments, suppositories, powders, and liquids. \n",
      "\n",
      "The composition may also contain one or more additional active agents effective in treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The dosage amounts of these secondary active agents will depend on various factors such as the intended patient population, the particular progressive neuropathic disease symptom or condition to be treated, potential synergies between the active agents administered, and the like. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also mentions the possibility of formulating the composition for sustained delivery to improve stability and extend the half-life of ibudilast. This can be achieved by incorporating ibudilast into a carrier or vehicle such as liposomes, nonresorbable impermeable polymers, swellable polymers, or resorbable polymers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also discusses the possibility of providing a kit containing at least one combination composition of the invention, accompanied by instructions for use.The patent describes a method of treating a patient diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of ibudilast or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The dosage ranges between 1-240 mg/day. The ibudilast can be administered for at least six months, one year, or two years. It can be administered at least once daily and can be taken orally. The dosage amount can be 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 90 mg/day, or 120 mg/day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also describes the formulation of the drug, which can be a sustained release formulation, allowing the drug components to be released or absorbed slowly over time. The drug can be contained in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also provides examples of clinical trials conducted using ibudilast in patients with multiple sclerosis. The results showed benefits such as prolongation of time to relapse, lessened likelihood for sustained disability progression, reduction in brain volume loss, and reduction in conversion of acute lesions to persistent black holes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent claims are focused on the method of treating ALS with ibudilast, with specific claims around the dosage, duration of treatment, and method of administration.\n"

No. 17/307,858, filed May 4, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by refer\\xad ence.\\n\\nTECHNICAL FIELD\\n\\n[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods for treat\\xad ing depression using aticaprant.\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\n[0003] Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) and their native ligand dynorphin are localized in areas of the brain that effect reward and stress and may play a key role in mood, stress, and addictive disorders. Chronic stress, substance abuse, and acute withdrawal lead to increased dynorphin expression, activating KORs and subsequent downstream signaling pathways to inhibit mesolimbic dopamine surge, contributing to negative affective states. The behavioral pharmacology of KOR antagonism has been tested in animal models of anhedonia, depression, and anxiety and found to have meaningful effects that may translate to therapeutic benefit in humans. KOR antagonists may be effective for the treatment of patients with mood disorders, perhaps by modulating the negative affective state associated with stress response.\\n\\n[0004] Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depres\\xad sion. At least mild symptoms of anhedonia are present in about 90% of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). Only about 50% of patients with MDD show a meaningful response (>50% improvement to a first line antidepressant treatment), leaving many patients with substantial persistent impairment. Therapeutic strategies such as switching antidepressants and using adjuvant drug treatments can improve response, however almost 40% of patients remain symptomatic and fail to achieve full remis\\xad s10n.\\n\\n[0005] What is needed are treatments for patients having depression and anhedonia.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\n[0006] In some aspects, the present disclosure is directed to methods for treating major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the patient has had an inadequate response to other antidepressant therapy prior to treatment with aticaprant, including, for example, an inad\\xad equate response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or a combination thereof.\\n\\n[0007] In other aspects, the methods comprise adjunctive treatment with one or more antidepressants. The one or more antidepressants can include, for example, a selective sero\\xad tonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or a combination thereof. [0008] In further aspects, the disclosure relates to ati\\xad caprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for\\n\\n\\nuse in a method of treating major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceu\\xad tically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\n[0009] In yet other aspects, the disclosure also relates to aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, comprising administration of an effective amount of ati\\xad caprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\n[001OJ In still further aspects, the disclosure also relates to the use of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treat\\xad ment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, wherein the treatment comprises administration of an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\n[0011] In other aspects, the disclosure further relates to a package or pharmaceutical product comprising aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with instructions for the treatment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, wherein the treatment comprises administration of an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\n\\n\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n\\n[0012]  FIG. 1 is the trial design of Example 1.\\n\\n[0013] FIG. 2 is a line graph showing the MADRS (Mont\\xad gomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) total score: least squares mean changes from baseline (±SE) during the treatment period for the enriched intent-to-treat (eITT) analysis set.\\n\\n[0014] FIG. 3 is a plot showing MADRS total score changes at treatment week 6 for enriched and full popula\\xad tion: MMRM results-estimated LS means and comparison versus placebo.\\n\\n[0015] FIG. 4 is a line graph showing SHAPS (Snaith\\xad Hamilton Pleasure Scale) total score: least squares mean changes from baseline (±SE) during the treatment period for the eITT analysis set.\\n\\n[0016] FIG. 5 is a plot showing SHAPS total score changes at treatment week 6 for enriched and full popula\\xad tion: MMRM (Mixed-effects Model for Repeated Measures) Results-estimated LSMeans and comparison versus pla\\xad cebo\\n\\n[0017] FIG. 6 is a line graph showing MADRS total score: mean values (±SE) over time for the eITT analysis set.\\n\\n[0018] FIG. 7A is a line graph showing MADRS total score: mean values (±SE) over time for the full intent-to\\xad treat (fITT) analysis set.

Because MDD alone is difficult to treat, treatment patients having anhedonia are even more problematic since their ability to gauge pleasure is impaired. Thus, such patients often receive inadequate treatment due to ineffective medications, repeated and unnecessary medical appointments, lack of patient compli\\xad ance, overall patient frustration, among others. Further, antidepressants are known to have a variety of side effects such as weight gain, metabolic side effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, cognitive impairment, among others. Thus, patients may choose to refrain from or stop taking antidepressants to avoid or prevent any side-effects.\\n\\n[0038] The methods described herein are effective in man\\xad aging the patient\\'s depression and anhedonia using ati\\xad caprant. Desirably, the methods successfully permit the patient to manage their depression while simultaneously reducing anhedonia. In particular embodiments, the patients treated according to the described methods have moderate to severe anhedonia. The term \"anhedonia\" as used herein refers to the lack of or decreased ability to experience pleasure in daily activities. The term anhedonia includes loss of pleasure in sensory experiences (i.e., touch, taste, smell), as well as social interactions. In some embodiments, anhe\\xad donia and depressed mood are diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode as part of MDD. Anhedonia also describes deficits in one or more components of reward\\xad related behavior, also known as the pleasure cycle, such as wanting, liking, and learning. The pleasure cycle can be divided into three phases: the appetitive phase (dominated by wanting), the consummatory phase (dominated by lik\\xad ing), and the satiety phase (dominated by learning). The appetitive phase is characterized by the initial energy expen\\xad diture to attain a reward; the consummatory phase is enjoy\\xad ment of the reward; and the satiety phase is characterized by learning and feedback integration.\\n\\n[0039] To assess a potential effect on anhedonia, an anhe\\xad donia scale may be used. For example, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) analysis is a validated scale for the measurement of anhedonia. The SHAPS is a subject com\\xad pleted scale in which subjects score whether or not they experience pleasure in performing a list of activities or experiences. The SHAPS is a self-reported 14-item instru\\xad ment, developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. Subjects score whether they experience pleasure in perform\\xad ing a list of activities or experiences. Subjects can rate the answers as 1-4 where 1 indicates \"Definitely agree\", 2 indicates \"Agree\", 3 indicates \"Disagree\" and 4 indicates \"Definitely disagree\". The subject\\'s item responses are summed to provide a total score ranging from 14 to 56. A higher total SHAPS score indicates higher levels of current anhedonia. Physician/clinical judgment can be used to assess anhedonia separately or in conjunction with an anhe\\xad donia scale.\\n\\n[0040] In some embodiments, the patient has moderate anhedonia. In other embodiments, the patient has severe anhedonia. An assessment of moderate or severe anhedonia is typically determined physician/clinical judgment and/or by one or more tests that provide insight into whether a patient has anhedonia. For example, the severity of the anhedonia may be determined using the SHAPS method. In some embodiments, a patient with moderate or severe anhe-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndonia is considered to have a high level of anhedonia. For example, a patient with a SHAPS score of 38 or greater is considered to have moderate to severe anhedonia that can be considered a high level of anhedonia. In some embodiments, a high level of anhedonia is reflected by a SHAPS score of at least about 40, about 42, about 44, about 46, about 48,\\n\\nabout 50, about 52, about 54, about 56, about 58, or higher. A patient with mild or no anhedonia would be considered to have a low level of anhedonia that is assessed by physician/ clinical judgment and/or one or more tests. For example, a patient with a SHAPS score of less than 38 is considered to have low anhedonia. In certain embodiments, a patient with mild anhedonia may have a SHAPS score of 20 to less than 38, for example, a SHAPS score of 20 to about 36, about 22\\n\\nto about 36, about 24 to about 36, about 26 to about 36,\\n\\nabout 26 to about 34, about 26 to about 32, about 26 to about\\n\\n30, about 26 to about 28, about 28 to about 36, about 28 to\\n\\nabout 36, about 30, to about 36, about 32 to about 36, about\\n\\n34 to about 36, about 20 to about 34, about 22 to about 34,\\n\\nabout 24 to about 34, about 26 to about 32, about 26 to about\\n\\n30, about 26 to about 28, about 28 to about 36, about 28 to\\n\\nabout 34, about 28 to about 32, about 28 to about 30, about\\n\\n30 to about 36, about 30 to about 34, about 30 to about 32,\\n\\nabout 32 to about 36, about 32 to about 34, or about 34 to about 36. Typically, a SHAPS score of less than 20 can be considered to correspond to normal hedonic functioning, and for purposes of this disclosure, would fall into the low category of anhedonia, e.g., a SHAPS score of less than 38.\\n\\n[0041] In some embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced from a high level of anhedonia to a low level of anhedonia. In yet other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedo\\xad nia is reduced by at least about 40%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant. In yet other embodi\\xad ments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by at least about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 95%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant. In still further embodiments, In yet other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by about 40 to about 90%, about 50 to about 90%, about 60\\n\\nto about 90%, about 70 to about 90%, about 80 to about\\n\\n90%, about 40 to about 80%, about 50 to about 80%, about\\n\\n60 to about 80%, about 70 to about 80%, about 40 to about\\n\\n70%, about 50 to about 70%, about 60 to about 70%, about\\n\\n40 to about 60%, about 50 to about 60%, or about 50 to about 60%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with ati\\xad caprant. In other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is ameliorated, i.e., reduced by 100%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant.\\n\\n[0042] Reduction of anhedonia after initiating treatment with aticaprant may be measured relative to the anhedonia of the patient as measured before treatment with aticaprant, i.e., a baseline anhedonia measurement. In doing so, the treating clinician is able to calculate the change of anhedonia from the baseline to the real time anhedonia measurement at any point after treatment with aticaprant. Thus, standard meth\\xad ods for measuring anhedonia may be used, such as an anhedonia scale, e.g., SHAPS.\\n\\n[0043] Desirably, a baseline anhedonia measurement is obtained no more than about 1 week before initiating treatment with aticaprant. In some embodiments, a baseline\\n\\n\\nanhedonia measurement is obtained about 7 days, about 6 days, about 5 days, about 4 days, about 3 days, about 2 days, or about 1 day before treatment with aticaprant. In further embodiments, a baseline anhedonia measurement is obtained about 24 hours, about 18 hours, about 12 hours, about 8 hours, about 4 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hours, about 30 minutes, or about 15 minutes before initiating treatment with aticaprant.\\n\\n[0044] The patient\\'s change of anhedonia will depend on several factors including, without limitation, anhedonia severity, patient\\'s sensitivity to aticaprant, other pharmaceu\\xad tical agents being administered, among others. In some embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks of aticaprant treatment. In other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks of aticaprant treatment. In further embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks to about 6 weeks, and, in certain embodiments, through week 6, of aticaprant treatment. In certain embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by at least about 40%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following about 6 weeks of the treatment with aticaprant. In further embodiments, the anhedonia of the patient is reduced within about 3 weeks, and in some embodiments within about 3 weeks to about 6 weeks, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale and/or by physician/clinical judgement.\\n\\n[0045] The methods described herein were found to not only improve the patient\\'s depression and anhedonia symp\\xad toms, but resulted in fewer antidepressant side effects. Doing so resulted in less absenteeism (i.e., more visits or interac\\xad tions with physicians), greater cognitive functioning, improvements in health-related quality of life, more interest and engagement in everyday activities, improvement in family and inter-personal relationships, ability to function in the workplace, fewer hospitalizations, among others.\\n\\n[0046] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" refer to a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. Preferably, the patient has experienced and/or exhibited at least one symptom of the disease or disorder to be treated and/or prevented. In some embodiments, the patient is an adult. As used herein, the term \"adult\" as used herein refers to a human that is about 18 years of age or older. In certain aspects, the patient is an elderly adult, i.e., greater than or equal to 65 years of age.\\n\\n[0047] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the terms \"treating\", \"treatment\" and the like, shall include the man\\xad agement and care of a subject or patient (preferably mam\\xad mal, more preferably human) for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the adminis\\xad tration of a compound described herein to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, alleviate one or more of the symptoms or complications, or eliminate the disease, condition, or disorder.\\n\\n[0048] As used herein, the term \"depression\" (also referred to as depressive disorder) includes major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, situational depression, anhedonia, melancholic, mid-life depression, late-life depression, bipolar depression, depression due to identifiable stressors, treatment resistant depression, or combinations thereof. In certain embodi\\xad ments, the depression is major depressive disorder. In other\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nembodiments, the major depressive disorder is with melan\\xad cholic features or anxious distress. In further embodiments, the depression is treatment-resistant depression. In other embodiments, the depression is major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation.\\n\\n[0049] As known in the art, a patient is considered to have major depressive disorder if exhibiting five or more symp\\xad toms during the same two week period that are a change from previous functioning; depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure must be present; excluding symptoms clearly attributable to another medical condition.

In some embodiments, the MDD is mild. In other embodiments, the MDD is moderate. In further embodiments, the MDD is severe. As used herein, \"mild MDD\" applies to a patient having few, if any, symp\\xad\\n\\n\\nTABLE B-continued\\n\\nDSM-5 Criteria for MDD\\n\\n\\tSymptoms cause significant distress or impairment\\n\\n\\tNot attributable to medical condition\\n\\n\\tExclude schizophrenia disorders\\n\\n\\tNo hx of mania or hypomania\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMust have all 4\\n\\n\\n\\ntoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning. The mild MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.0) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.0). \"Moderate MDD\" applies to a patient having a number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or func\\xad tional impairment are between those specified for \"mild\" and \"severe.\" The moderate MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.1) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.1). \"Severe MDD\" applies to a patient where the number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of symptoms is seriously dis\\xad tressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning, and urgent symptom control is necessary. In some embodiments, the severe MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.2) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.2). In other embodiments, MDD is classified according to the DSM-5 definition of Table B.\\n\\n\\n[0052]  Several scales are known in the art that may be\\n\\nutilized to diagnose or monitor patients with MDD. Examples of these scales include, without limitation, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale, Symp\\xad toms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS), Self\\xad Assessment of Treatment Experience (SATE) scale, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ), i.e., MGH\\xad ATRQ.\\n\\n[0053] In some embodiments, MADRS is utilized to diag\\xad nose and/or monitor the patient. MADRS is a 10-item rating scale that is used in antidepressant studies. It is clinician\\xad administered and designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS scale is validated, reliable, and acceptable to regulatory health authorities as a primary scale to determine efficacy in major depression. In some embodiments, MADRS is administered using the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symp\\xad toms), sUlllilled for a total possible score of 60. Higher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nscores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\n[0054] In other embodiments, CGI-S is utilized to diag\\xad nose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. CGI-S is a scale that rates the severity of the subject\\'s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician\\'s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis and improvement with treatment. CGI-S provides an overall clinician-deter\\xad mined summary measure of severity of subject\\'s illness that considers all available information, including knowledge of subject\\'s history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and impact of symptoms on subject\\'s ability to function. CGI-S evaluates severity of psychopathology on scale of Oto 7. Subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at time of rating according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among most extremely ill patients.\\n\\n[0055] In further embodiments, SMDDS is utilized to diagnose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. SMDDS is a subjective rating of the patient. The SMDDS is a 16-item PRO measure. Each item is rated by the subject according to a 5-point Likert scale. Subjects respond to each question using a rating scale between 0 (\"Not at all\" or \"Never\") to 4 (\"Extremely\" or \"Always\"). The total score ranges from 0 to 60. The SMDDS uses a 7-day recall period and verbal rating scales. Higher score indicates more severe depressive symptomatology.\\n\\n[0056] In yet other embodiments, SATE is utilized to diagnose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. SATE is a one to three questionnaire administered when the subject is unable to complete other evaluations, i.e., away from the clinical setting such as at home. SATE is useful to evaluate improvement or deterioration of depressive symptoms of the subjects over a short period of time. For rating overall depression, subject selected one option out oflmproved, not changed or got worse; for depression improvement, subject selected one option out of slightly improved, much improved, very much improved and for depression worsen subject selected slightly worse, much worse, very much worse. See, Table C.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE C\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSATE Questionnaire\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 1: Since starting this study medication, overall would you say your depression is:\\n\\n0 Improved\\n\\n0 Got worse\\n\\n0 Not changed\\n\\nIf the subject selects answer 1 (Improved), following question is asked: Question 2: How much did your depression improve?\\n\\n0 Slightly improved\\n\\n0 Much improved\\n\\n0 Very much improved\\n\\nIf the subject selects answer 3 (Got worse), following question is asked: Question 3: How much did your depression worsen?\\n\\n0 Slightly worse\\n\\n0 Much worse\\n\\n0 Very much worse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0057] The MGH-ATRQ is a self-rated scale used to determine treatment resistance in patient\\'s having MDD. This questionnaire examines the antidepressant treatment\\n\\n\\nhistory, using specific anchor points to define the adequacy of both dose and duration of each antidepressant trial, and the degree of symptomatic improvement. The MGH-ATRQ permits determining treatment resistance in depression and is known to those skilled in the art.\\n\\n[0058] In certain embodiments, the patient had an inad\\xad equate response to other antidepressant therapy (i.e., anti\\xad depressant medication or treatment used to treat depression other than aticaprant). \"Inadequate response\" as used herein refers to a patient experiencing a less than about 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. Typically, the inadequate response is during a current/active episode of the depression. In some embodiments, an inadequate response refers to a patient experiencing about 26 to less than about 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. In other embodiments, an inadequate response refers to a patient experiencing about 26 to about 49, about 26 to about 45, about 26 to about 40, about 26 to about 35,\\n\\nabout 26 to about 30, about 30 to about 49, about 30 to about\\n\\n45, about 30 to about 40, about 30 to about 35, about 35 to\\n\\nabout 49, about 35 to about 45, about 35 to about 40, about\\n\\n40 to about 49, or about 40 to about 45% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. A patient\\'s response may be measured by one or more scales described herein and/or by physician/clinical judgment. In some embodiments, an inadequate response is measured by MGH-ATRQ, MADRS, or SHAPS. In further embodiments, an inadequate response is measured by MGH\\xad ATRQ.\\n\\n[0059] To the extent a patient is said to have a partial response to treatment, this refers to some minor to moderate symptomatic improvement since the initiation of treatment, but some of the initial symptoms are still present and troubling to the patient and these persistent symptoms still affect behavior and function. For instance, the patient\\'s motivation, productivity, and interest in his or her usual activities may still be impaired.\\n\\n[0060] Antidepressant therapy refers to any pharmaceuti\\xad cal agent which can be used to treat depression. Suitable examples include, without limitation, mono-amine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, tetracyclics, non-cyclics, triazolopyri\\xad dines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), sero\\xad tonin receptor antagonists, serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic agents, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, or antipsychotics (typical or atypical antipsychotics). Examples of mono\\xad amine oxidase inhibitors include phenelzine, tranylcyprom\\xad ine, moclobemide, and the like. Examples of tricyclics include imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, nortrip\\xad tyline, doxepin, protriptyline, trimipramine, clomipramine, amoxapine, and the like. Examples of tetracyclics includes maprotiline, and the like. Examples of non-cyclics include nomifensine, and the like. Examples of triazolopyridines include trazodone, and the like. Examples of SSRis include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, and the like. Examples of sero\\xad tonin receptor antagonists include nefazadone, and the like. Examples of SNRis include venlafaxine, milnacipran, des\\xad venlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran and the like. Examples of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic agents include mirtazapine, and the like. Examples of noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors include reboxetine, edivoxetine and the like. Examples of typical antipsychotics include phenothi-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nazines (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, levomepromazin), thioxan\\xad thenes (e.g., thiothixene, flupentixol), butyrophenones (e.g., haloperidol), dibenzoxazepines (e.g., loxapine), dihydroin\\xad dolones (e.g., molindone), substituted benzamides (e.g., sulpride, amisulpride), and the like. Examples of atypical antipsychotics include paliperidone, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, zotepine, ziprasidone, iloperidone, perospirone, blonanserin, sertindole, ORG-5222, sonepipra\\xad zole, aripiprazole, nemonapride, SR-31742, CX-516, SC-111, NE-100, divalproate (mood stabilizer) and the like. In further embodiments, the antidepressant therapy includes natural products such as Kava-Kava, St. John\\'s Wort, and the like or dietary supplements such as s-adenosylmethio\\xad nine, and the like. In yet other embodiments, the antidepres\\xad sant therapy includes neuropeptides such as thyrotropin\\xad releasing hormone and the like or compounds targeting neuropeptide receptors such as neurokinin receptor antago\\xad nists and the like. In still further embodiments, the antide\\xad pressant therapy is a hormone such as triiodothyronine, and the like. In other embodiments, the antidepressant therapy is SSRI, SNRI, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the antidepressant is a SSRI that is escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine or citalopram. In other embodiments, the antidepressant is a SNRT that is venlafaxine, duloxetine, vortioxeine or desvenlafaxine. There are also non-pharma\\xad cologic treatments, such as psychotherapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, that are also available and options for adjunctive therapy.\\n\\n[0061] Therapeutically effective amounts/dosage levels and dosage regimens for the other antidepressant therapy may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, therapeutic dosage amounts and regimens for pharmaceutical agents approved for sale are publicly avail\\xad able, for example as listed on packaging labels, in standard dosage guidelines, in standard dosage references such as the Physician\\'s Desk Reference (Medical Economics Company or online at http:///www.pdrel.com) or other sources.\\n\\n[0062] In some embodiments, other antidepressant therapy may include one antidepressant medication. In other embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes two or more antidepressant medications. In further embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes two antidepressant medications. In yet other embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes three antidepressant medications. The attending physician would be able to select suitable antide\\xad pressant therapies for use as described herein.\\n\\n[0063] In certain embodiments, the patient was receiving treatment with other antidepressant therapy prior to receiv\\xad ing aticaprant. In some embodiments, the patient was receiv\\xad ing treatment with other antidepressant therapy that com\\xad prised a SSRI, SNRI, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the patient stopped treatment with other anti\\xad depressant therapy before initiating treatment with ati\\xad caprant.\\n\\n[0064] Also encompassed by the methods described herein include adjunctive treatment with an effective amount of one or more antidepressants. As used herein, the term \"adjunctive treatment\" and \"adjunctive therapy\" shall mean treatment of a patient in need thereof by administering aticaprant in combination with one or more antidepressant (s), wherein aticaprant and the antidepressant(s) are admin\\xad istered by any suitable means, simultaneously, sequentially, separately, or in a single pharmaceutical formulation.\\n\\n\\n[0065] In some aspects, aticaprant is administered adjunc\\xad tively with other antidepressant(s) currently being adminis\\xad tered to the patient, including current antidepressant(s) to which the patient had an inadequate response. In other embodiments, aticaprant is administered adjunctively with an antidepressant(s) not previously administered to the patient. In still other embodiments, aticaprant is adminis\\xad tered in a regimen with an antidepressant(s) previously administered to the patient.\\n\\n[0066] Where aticaprant and other antidepressant(s) are administered in separate dosage forms, the number of dos\\xad ages administered per day for each active compound may be the same or different and more typically different. The antidepressant may be dosed as prescribed by the attending physician and/or by its label and aticaprant is dosed as described herein. Typically, a patient is under concurrent treatment with both an antidepressant and aticaprant, where both are administered by their prescribed dosing regimens. The aticaprant and antidepressant(s) may be administered according to simultaneous or alternating regimens, at the same or different times during the course of the therapy, concurrently in divided or single forms.\\n\\n[0067] Aticaprant and the antidepressant(s) may be administered via the same or different routes of administra\\xad tion. Examples of suitable methods of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, intravenous (iv), intra\\xad nasal (in) intramuscular (im), subcutaneous (sc), transder\\xad mal, buccal, or rectal. In some embodiments, aticaprant is administered orally.\\n\\n[0068] Treatment with aticaprant as described herein has several advantages over the treatments in the art. In some embodiments, the patient does not experience many of the side effects that are associated with other antidepressants, i.e., antidepressants other than aticaprant. In certain aspects, the patient does not experience weight gain during the treatment with aticaprant. As used herein, the term \"weight gain\" refers to an increase in the weight of patient, relative to the weight of the patient before taking aticaprant or the weight of the patient that is assessed at the time of the initial administration of the aticaprant. In certain embodiments, the patient may actually see a decrease in overall weight, relative to the weight of the patient before taking aticaprant. In further embodiments, the patient\\'s weight is stable, i.e., does not increase or decrease. In certain embodiments, the patient does not experience a clinically relevant weight gain which is characterized as a weight increase of 2:7%.\\n\\n[0069] This is contrary to many other antidepressants where weight gain, including clinically relevant weight gain, is a common, but unfortunate, side-effect.\\n\\n[0070] In further aspects, the patient does not experience a decrease in sexual functioning during the treatment with aticaprant. As used herein, the term \"decrease in sexual functioning\" refers to reducing or lessening of one or more components of the human sex drive, i.e., sexual functioning. In some embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises one or more of sexual drive, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication, erection, orgasm achievement, or orgasm satisfaction. In other embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises sexual drive. In further embodiments, the sexual functioning com\\xad prises vaginal lubrication satisfaction. In further embodi\\xad ments, the sexual functioning comprises orgasm achieve\\xad ment. In yet other embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises orgasm satisfaction. Desirably, the patient\\'s sexual functioning is assessed at the time of initial admin-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nistration of the aticaprant. Thus, the patient\\'s sexual func\\xad tioning while taking aticaprant can be compared to the patient\\'s sexual functioning before administration of ati\\xad caprant. Sexual functioning may be assessed by using stan\\xad dard scales and techniques such as the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX). The ASEX is used to investigate whether aticaprant has a further positive or negative effect on sexual function. The ASEX is 5 item rating scale admin\\xad istered to patients that quantifies sexual drive, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication or penile erection, ability to reach orgasm and satisfaction. Scores range from 5 to 30, and two different versions of the scale are available (males and females).\\n\\n[0071] Other scales may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of the methods used herein to treat the patient. Examples include the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KS S), and Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS). The CPFQ is a brief self-report scale that provides additional information regarding the impact of adjunctive treatment on aspects of cognitive and executive function including atten\\xad tion, memory and mental acuity. Subjects with MDD are often reported to have difficulties with functioning in this area. The KSS is a subject-reported assessment used to rate sleepiness on a scale of 1 to 9, ranging from \"extremely alert\" (1) to \"very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep\" (9). The TEPS includes 18 items, 2 subscales designed to distinguish between anticipatory and consum\\xad matory pleasure.\\n\\n[0072] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term \"aticaprant\" refers to 3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl) pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide, i.e., the follow\\xad ing compound:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand is also known as JNJ-67953964, CERC-501, and LY-2456302. In some embodiments, \"aticaprant\" refers to the (S)-enantiomer of aticaprant, i.e., the following com\\xad pound:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalso known as (S)-aticaprant or (S)-3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5- dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide. In other embodiments, the aticaprant used in the methods described herein is substantially free of the (R)-enantiomer, i.e., (R)-aticaprant or (R)-3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5-dimethylphe\\xad nyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide having the following structure:\\n\\n\\n\\no\\n\\no---0     0\\n\\nNH,\\n\\no\\n\\nF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0073] In other embodiments, the aticaprant contains less than about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In further embodiments, the aticaprant contains less than about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5, about 4, about\\n\\n3, about 2, about 1, about 0.5, about 0.1, about 0.005, or about 0.001% by weight, based on the weight of the ati\\xad caprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In yet other embodiments, the aticaprant contains about 0.001 to about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In still further embodiments, the aticaprant contains about 0.001 to about 10%, about\\n\\n0.001 to about 5%, about 0.001 to about 1, about 0.001 to\\n\\nabout 0.5, about 0.001 to about 0.1, about 0.1 to about 5,\\n\\nabout 0.1 to about 1, about 0.1 to about 5, or about 0.5 to about 5% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant.\\n\\n[0074] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of aticaprant are also contemplated by the present invention, which may be readily selected by those skilled in the art. A \"pharmaceu\\xad tically acceptable salt\" refers a salt of aticaprant that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject.

Aticaprant was evaluated as an adjunctive therapy; there\\xad fore, eligible subjects were maintained on their SSRI/SNRT treatment without change throughout the study. At least 50% of recruited subjects had to be anhedonic (as measured by SHAPS total score;;,;20).\\n\\n[0172]  A. Objectives\\n\\n[0173] The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of aticaprant compared to placebo when administered as adjunctive treatment in subjects with MDD partially respon\\xad sive to SSRI/SNRI treatment in terms of reduction of symptoms of depression, as assessed by the change from baseline on the MADRS in non-responders during the placebo lead-in period.\\n\\n[0174]  The secondary objectives are:\\n\\n[0175] i. To evaluate the efficacy of aticaprant compared to placebo when administered as adjunctive treatment in sub\\xad jects with MDD partially responsive to SSRI/SNRI treat\\xad ment in terms of reduction of symptoms of depression, as assessed by the change from baseline on the MADRS in both responders and non-responders during the placebo lead-in period.\\n\\n[0176] ii. To investigate the overall safety and tolerability of treatment with adjunctive aticaprant in subjects with MDD when used in combination with a SSRI or SNRI. [0177] iii. To investigate the effect of aticaprant versus placebo on depression related anhedonia as assessed by the\\n\\nSHAPS.\\n\\n[0178] iv. To investigate the effect of aticaprant on symp\\xad toms of depression using the Clinical Global Impression\\xad Severity (CGI-S), the patient reported Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS) and the self-assess\\xad ment of treatment experience (SATE).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0179] v. To investigate the effect of aticaprant on symp\\xad toms of anxiety using the HAM-A and on core symptoms of anxiety using the HAM-A6 subscale.\\n\\n[0180] vi. To assess the plasma PK of aticaprant in sub\\xad jects with MDD and explore its relationship with efficacy and safety parameters.\\n\\n[0181]  Secondary exploratory objectives include:\\n\\n[0182] i. To explore the effect of aticaprant on aspects of cognitive and executive function using the CPFQ.\\n\\n[0183] ii. To explore mood-related biomarkers (including but not limited to growth factors, HPAaxis markers, immune system activation, metabolic markers) and genetic/epigen\\xad etic variation that may be related to clinical response, nonresponse, or safety and tolerability parameters of ati\\xad caprant.\\n\\n[0184]  B. Study Design\\n\\n[0185] For each subject, the study consisted of two phases: a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a double-blind treatment phase lasting 11 weeks. See, FIG. 1.\\n\\n[0186] Subjects with MDD who have had treatment initi\\xad ated with a permitted SSRI/SNRI and have had an inad\\xad equate or only partial response to this treatment were screened. Assessments include the MINI, Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (TRQ), and MADRS. [0187] The treatment phase consisted of 3 periods. A placebo lead-in period of concealed duration, after which\\n\\n\\nsubjects entered the double-blind treatment period when they were randomly assigned to 10 mg aticaprant (two 5 mg capsules) or continue placebo for 6 weeks. Each capsule contained aticaprant (5 mg), microcrystalline cellulose (94. 95 mg), and magnesium stearate (0.05 mg) in a hard gelatin capsule. Subjects who completed the treatment period, entered the withdrawal period and were treated with placebo for the remaining time of the treatment phase. The total duration for each subject was approximately 16 weeks. There were 11 scheduled visits, including screening. An overall flow diagram is shown in FIG. 1.\\n\\n[0188] Subjects were screened within 35 to 2 days prior to Day 1 to ascertain their eligibility per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The symptoms of depression were assessed using the structured interview guide for the MADRS.\\n\\n[0189]  Double-Blind Treatment Phase\\n\\n[0190] The duration of the double-blind treatment phase was 11 weeks divided into 3 periods. The subject received medication after completion of the visit on Day 1. The first dose was taken at home on Day 2. All medication was taken in fasting condition. At Visits 3, 4 and 5, the subjects were re-randomized to blind subjects the duration of the placebo lead-in period. During the double-blind phase, the subjects visited the center for out-patient visits every 1 to 2 weeks.

Subjects remained blinded to exact timing of the randomization, response criterion and drug treatment assignment for each subject. [0193] Withdrawal period: Subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period prior to the end of Week 11 entered the withdrawal period where they were treated with placebo for the remaining time of the treatment phase. [0194] C. Dosage and Administration\\n\\n[0195] Aticaprant was supplied as 5-mg capsules. Placebo was supplied as matching capsules. All subjects took 2 capsules QD. The capsules were taken daily from Day 2 to Day 78 in fasting condition with some water (fasting for at least 4 hours before dosing). Medication was taken before breakfast. If the subject has forgotten to take the medication before breakfast, this was done before the next following meal, at the latest at dinner of the same day. If the subject remembered later than dinner, the dose of that day was omitted, and the subject took the dose before breakfast on the next day.\\n\\n[0196] When Visit 11 was planned up to 3 days later, the subject continued medication until Visit 11.\\n\\n[0197] The capsules were swallowed whole and not chewed, divided, dissolved or crushed.

Evaluations of Efficacy\\n\\n[0219] At the end of the lead-in period, response status of the subjects was assessed according to the double-blind response criteria based on reduction in MADRS relative to lead-in baseline. Both lead-in placebo responders and lead\\xad in placebo non-responders were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either aticaprant or placebo in the treatment period. The randomization was stratified by lead-in response status (non-responders: <30% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score at the end of the lead-in period vs responders: 2:30% reduction from baseline at the end of the lead-in period) and presence/absence of anhedonia (presence defined as SHAPS total score2:20).\\n\\n[0220] Treatment duration: The study consisted of two periods: a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a double\\xad blind treatment phase of 11 weeks. The double-blind treat-\\n\\n\\nment phase of the trial consisted of 3 periods. The first period was a placebo lead-in of 3 weeks, after which subjects entered the treatment period when they were ran\\xad domly assigned to aticaprant or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects who successfully completed the treatment period were treated with placebo during a 2-week with\\xad drawal period, i.e., Period 3. The total duration for each subject was approximately 16 weeks.\\n\\n[0221] Primary analysis set for efficacy: The efficacy analysis is based on the eITT set defined as all enrolled lead-in placebo non-responders who were randomized into the treatment period, received at least one dose of medica\\xad tion, and have at least one post-baseline MADRS assess\\xad ment during the treatment period. The primary analysis set is used for all efficacy endpoints.\\n\\n[0222] Secondary analysis set for efficacy: A secondary analysis set is the f!TT set defined as all enrolled subjects who were randomized into the treatment period, received at least one dose of medication, and have at least one post\\xad baseline MADRS assessment during the treatment period. The secondary analysis set is used for all efficacy endpoints to examine the effect in the general population, which may be useful for designing subsequent studies in the develop\\xad ment program.\\n\\n[0223] Analysis set for safety: The safety analysis is based on the full safety analysis set, defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of medication in the treatment period.\\n\\n[0224] The efficacy endpoints were presented for both the eITT and the f!TT.\\n\\n[0225] Level of significance: The analysis of primary efficacy endpoint was performed at a significance level of\\n\\n0.20 (one-sided). The analysis of secondary efficacy end\\xad points was performed at a significance level of 0.20 (two\\xad sided). No adjustment for multiple comparisons was per\\xad formed.\\n\\n[0226]  F.

See, FIG.\\n\\n2. The mean change from treatment baseline (SD) in MADRS total score at treatment week 6 was -10.2 (8.44) for aticaprant and -8.2 (8.53) for placebo. The observed effect size was 0.23.

The overall completion rate for the full ITT analysis set is 95%. This contrasts with completion rates of approximately 85% for studies of adjunctive aripiprazole (Pae, CNS Drugs, 2011; 25, 109-127) and 45-62% for\\n\\nadjunctive quetiapine (El Khalili cited above). In total 4 subjects (3.3%) discontinued the study: 2 subjects in placebo and 2 subjects in aticaprant treatment group. See, Tables 30 and 31.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\toral antidepressant group is higher in the high anhedonia\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\ngroup as compared to the low anhedonia group.

Major depres\\xad sion itself is associated with increased sexual dysfunction, and many of the pharmacological treatments are known to worsen sexual functioning even further. In a large survey of nearly 5000 patients in France, it was estimated that in untreated patients with MDD, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction was 65%. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction increased to 71% for patients treated with antidepressant therapy.\\n\\n[0283] Sexual pleasure is an important component of hedonic tone. The brain reward circuitry is controlled by several areas: nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. It is hypothesized that treatment with kappa opioid receptors may restore the normal homeostatic balance in patients with overactivation. Treatment with aticaprant could potentially improve symptoms of anhedo\\xad nia. Other symptoms associated with the reward circuitry includes: sexual pleasure, lack of interest and lack of enjoy\\xad ment.\\n\\n[0284] Patients had their sexual functioning measured using a standard, well accepted rating scale: ASEX. See, Table 32.\\n\\n\\n\\nTABLE 32\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tASEX scores by treatment group\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlacebo\\n\\nAticaprant\\n\\n\\n\\nn - 84\\n\\nn - 85\\n\\nBaseline\\n\\n22.04\\n\\n21.26\\n\\nEndpoint\\n\\n21.36\\n\\n19.79\\n\\nAbsolute Change\\n\\n-0.68\\n\\n-1.47\\n\\nRelative % Change\\n\\n-3.09%\\n\\n-6.91%\\n\\n\\n\\n[0285] The mean change from treatment baseline (SD) in ASEX total score to week 6 was -1.5 (4.02) points for aticaprant compared to -0.7 (2.98) points for placebo. A lower score on the ASEX indicates improvement. The score reduction at week 6 was greater in the aticaprant group compared to placebo. This is unexpected because adjunctive\\n\\n\\ntory pleasure: orgasm satisfying, reach orgasm and vaginal lubrication/erection. Most of the improvements seen in items 3, 4 and 5 of FIG. 20.\\n\\n[0287]  (viii) Onset of Effect\\n\\n[0288] The onset of effect for aticaprant can be estimated from the study. FIG. 7B depicts the least squares mean change from baseline. A significant treatment effect favoring aticaprant was seen as early as week 3. At this point, aticaprant showed a statistically superior effect compared to placebo.\\n\\nExample 2: Single Dose Aticaprant as Adjunctive Antidepressant Therapy\\n\\n[0289] Study Design: A 6-week, multicenter, double\\xad blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aticaprant in adult and elderly subjects (18 to 74 years) who have MDD with prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH+), and who have had an inadequate response to a SSRI or a serotonin and SNRI in the current depressive episode. See, FIG. 21.\\n\\n[0290] For all subjects, this study will consist of 3 phases: an eligibility screening phase (up to 4 weeks prior to first dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase of 6 weeks, and a follow-up of 1-2 weeks. Subjects who have completed the double-blind phase may participate in an open-label long-term safety study.\\n\\n[0291] Sample Size and Randomization: Approximately 544 subjects with MDD with prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH+) and without prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH-) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adjunctive placebo or aticaprant to achieve a minimum of 314 adult subjects meeting predefined criteria for MDD ANH+ eligible to be included in the primary analysis. Randomization will be stratified by study site, age group (adults [<65 years], elderly [;;,;65 years]), baseline anhedonia, and baseline MADRS total score. All subjects will continue their baseline antidepres\\xad sant (SSRI/SNRI) during the entire study.\\n\\n[0292] Doses and Administration All eligible subjects will receive aticaprant or placebo in addition to their baseline SSRI/SNRI which will be continued during the entire study. Study medication will be taken daily.\\n\\n[0293]  Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\n[0294]  1. Age of 18 to 74 years (inclusive).\\n\\n[0295] 2. Be medically stable on the basis of physical examination (including a brief neurological examination), medical history, vital signs (including blood pressure), and 12-lead ECG performed at screening and baseline. If there are any abnormalities that are not specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, their significance must be determined [0296] 3. Be medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the results of the seruni chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, retesting of an abnormal lab values that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once during the screening phase\\n\\n[0297] 4.

An adequate trial is defined as an anlidepressant treatment for at least 6 weeks (and no greater than 12 months in the current episode) at or above the stable therapeutic dose specified in the MGH-ATRQ. must include the subject\\'s current anti depressant treatment. If the subject has received 2 SSRI/ SNRI treatments of sufficient dose and duration in the current episode, and has shown<25% improvement to both, then the subject would not qualify based on exclusion criterion (first exclusion criterion).\\n\\n[0299] 6.

No. 17/307,858, filed May 4, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by refer\\xad ence.TECHNICAL FIELD[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods for treat\\xad ing depression using aticaprant.BACKGROUND[0003] Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) and their native ligand dynorphin are localized in areas of the brain that effect reward and stress and may play a key role in mood, stress, and addictive disorders. Chronic stress, substance abuse, and acute withdrawal lead to increased dynorphin expression, activating KORs and subsequent downstream signaling pathways to inhibit mesolimbic dopamine surge, contributing to negative affective states. The behavioral pharmacology of KOR antagonism has been tested in animal models of anhedonia, depression, and anxiety and found to have meaningful effects that may translate to therapeutic benefit in humans. KOR antagonists may be effective for the treatment of patients with mood disorders, perhaps by modulating the negative affective state associated with stress response.[0004] Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depres\\xad sion. At least mild symptoms of anhedonia are present in about 90% of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). Only about 50% of patients with MDD show a meaningful response (>50% improvement to a first line antidepressant treatment), leaving many patients with substantial persistent impairment. Therapeutic strategies such as switching antidepressants and using adjuvant drug treatments can improve response, however almost 40% of patients remain symptomatic and fail to achieve full remis\\xad s10n.[0005] What is needed are treatments for patients having depression and anhedonia.SUMMARY[0006] In some aspects, the present disclosure is directed to methods for treating major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the patient has had an inadequate response to other antidepressant therapy prior to treatment with aticaprant, including, for example, an inad\\xad equate response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or a combination thereof.[0007] In other aspects, the methods comprise adjunctive treatment with one or more antidepressants. The one or more antidepressants can include, for example, a selective sero\\xad tonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or a combination thereof. [0008] In further aspects, the disclosure relates to ati\\xad caprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, foruse in a method of treating major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceu\\xad tically acceptable salt thereof.[0009] In yet other aspects, the disclosure also relates to aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, comprising administration of an effective amount of ati\\xad caprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.[001OJ In still further aspects, the disclosure also relates to the use of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treat\\xad ment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, wherein the treatment comprises administration of an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.[0011] In other aspects, the disclosure further relates to a package or pharmaceutical product comprising aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with instructions for the treatment of major depressive disorder in a human patient having moderate or severe anhedonia, in particular, wherein the treatment comprises administration of an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS[0012]  FIG. 1 is the trial design of Example 1.[0013] FIG. 2 is a line graph showing the MADRS (Mont\\xad gomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) total score: least squares mean changes from baseline (±SE) during the treatment period for the enriched intent-to-treat (eITT) analysis set.[0014] FIG. 3 is a plot showing MADRS total score changes at treatment week 6 for enriched and full popula\\xad tion: MMRM results-estimated LS means and comparison versus placebo.[0015] FIG. 4 is a line graph showing SHAPS (Snaith\\xad Hamilton Pleasure Scale) total score: least squares mean changes from baseline (±SE) during the treatment period for the eITT analysis set.[0016] FIG. 5 is a plot showing SHAPS total score changes at treatment week 6 for enriched and full popula\\xad tion: MMRM (Mixed-effects Model for Repeated Measures) Results-estimated LSMeans and comparison versus pla\\xad cebo[0017] FIG. 6 is a line graph showing MADRS total score: mean values (±SE) over time for the eITT analysis set.[0018] FIG. 7A is a line graph showing MADRS total score: mean values (±SE) over time for the full intent-to\\xad treat (fITT) analysis set.

Because MDD alone is difficult to treat, treatment patients having anhedonia are even more problematic since their ability to gauge pleasure is impaired. Thus, such patients often receive inadequate treatment due to ineffective medications, repeated and unnecessary medical appointments, lack of patient compli\\xad ance, overall patient frustration, among others. Further, antidepressants are known to have a variety of side effects such as weight gain, metabolic side effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, cognitive impairment, among others. Thus, patients may choose to refrain from or stop taking antidepressants to avoid or prevent any side-effects.[0038] The methods described herein are effective in man\\xad aging the patient\\'s depression and anhedonia using ati\\xad caprant. Desirably, the methods successfully permit the patient to manage their depression while simultaneously reducing anhedonia. In particular embodiments, the patients treated according to the described methods have moderate to severe anhedonia. The term \"anhedonia\" as used herein refers to the lack of or decreased ability to experience pleasure in daily activities. The term anhedonia includes loss of pleasure in sensory experiences (i.e., touch, taste, smell), as well as social interactions. In some embodiments, anhe\\xad donia and depressed mood are diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode as part of MDD. Anhedonia also describes deficits in one or more components of reward\\xad related behavior, also known as the pleasure cycle, such as wanting, liking, and learning. The pleasure cycle can be divided into three phases: the appetitive phase (dominated by wanting), the consummatory phase (dominated by lik\\xad ing), and the satiety phase (dominated by learning). The appetitive phase is characterized by the initial energy expen\\xad diture to attain a reward; the consummatory phase is enjoy\\xad ment of the reward; and the satiety phase is characterized by learning and feedback integration.[0039] To assess a potential effect on anhedonia, an anhe\\xad donia scale may be used. For example, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) analysis is a validated scale for the measurement of anhedonia. The SHAPS is a subject com\\xad pleted scale in which subjects score whether or not they experience pleasure in performing a list of activities or experiences. The SHAPS is a self-reported 14-item instru\\xad ment, developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. Subjects score whether they experience pleasure in perform\\xad ing a list of activities or experiences. Subjects can rate the answers as 1-4 where 1 indicates \"Definitely agree\", 2 indicates \"Agree\", 3 indicates \"Disagree\" and 4 indicates \"Definitely disagree\". The subject\\'s item responses are summed to provide a total score ranging from 14 to 56. A higher total SHAPS score indicates higher levels of current anhedonia. Physician/clinical judgment can be used to assess anhedonia separately or in conjunction with an anhe\\xad donia scale.[0040] In some embodiments, the patient has moderate anhedonia. In other embodiments, the patient has severe anhedonia. An assessment of moderate or severe anhedonia is typically determined physician/clinical judgment and/or by one or more tests that provide insight into whether a patient has anhedonia. For example, the severity of the anhedonia may be determined using the SHAPS method. In some embodiments, a patient with moderate or severe anhe-donia is considered to have a high level of anhedonia. For example, a patient with a SHAPS score of 38 or greater is considered to have moderate to severe anhedonia that can be considered a high level of anhedonia. In some embodiments, a high level of anhedonia is reflected by a SHAPS score of at least about 40, about 42, about 44, about 46, about 48,about 50, about 52, about 54, about 56, about 58, or higher. A patient with mild or no anhedonia would be considered to have a low level of anhedonia that is assessed by physician/ clinical judgment and/or one or more tests. For example, a patient with a SHAPS score of less than 38 is considered to have low anhedonia. In certain embodiments, a patient with mild anhedonia may have a SHAPS score of 20 to less than 38, for example, a SHAPS score of 20 to about 36, about 22to about 36, about 24 to about 36, about 26 to about 36,about 26 to about 34, about 26 to about 32, about 26 to about30, about 26 to about 28, about 28 to about 36, about 28 toabout 36, about 30, to about 36, about 32 to about 36, about34 to about 36, about 20 to about 34, about 22 to about 34,about 24 to about 34, about 26 to about 32, about 26 to about30, about 26 to about 28, about 28 to about 36, about 28 toabout 34, about 28 to about 32, about 28 to about 30, about30 to about 36, about 30 to about 34, about 30 to about 32,about 32 to about 36, about 32 to about 34, or about 34 to about 36. Typically, a SHAPS score of less than 20 can be considered to correspond to normal hedonic functioning, and for purposes of this disclosure, would fall into the low category of anhedonia, e.g., a SHAPS score of less than 38.[0041] In some embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced from a high level of anhedonia to a low level of anhedonia. In yet other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedo\\xad nia is reduced by at least about 40%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant. In yet other embodi\\xad ments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by at least about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 95%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant. In still further embodiments, In yet other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by about 40 to about 90%, about 50 to about 90%, about 60to about 90%, about 70 to about 90%, about 80 to about90%, about 40 to about 80%, about 50 to about 80%, about60 to about 80%, about 70 to about 80%, about 40 to about70%, about 50 to about 70%, about 60 to about 70%, about40 to about 60%, about 50 to about 60%, or about 50 to about 60%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with ati\\xad caprant. In other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is ameliorated, i.e., reduced by 100%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following treatment with aticaprant.[0042] Reduction of anhedonia after initiating treatment with aticaprant may be measured relative to the anhedonia of the patient as measured before treatment with aticaprant, i.e., a baseline anhedonia measurement. In doing so, the treating clinician is able to calculate the change of anhedonia from the baseline to the real time anhedonia measurement at any point after treatment with aticaprant. Thus, standard meth\\xad ods for measuring anhedonia may be used, such as an anhedonia scale, e.g., SHAPS.[0043] Desirably, a baseline anhedonia measurement is obtained no more than about 1 week before initiating treatment with aticaprant. In some embodiments, a baselineanhedonia measurement is obtained about 7 days, about 6 days, about 5 days, about 4 days, about 3 days, about 2 days, or about 1 day before treatment with aticaprant. In further embodiments, a baseline anhedonia measurement is obtained about 24 hours, about 18 hours, about 12 hours, about 8 hours, about 4 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hours, about 30 minutes, or about 15 minutes before initiating treatment with aticaprant.[0044] The patient\\'s change of anhedonia will depend on several factors including, without limitation, anhedonia severity, patient\\'s sensitivity to aticaprant, other pharmaceu\\xad tical agents being administered, among others. In some embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks of aticaprant treatment. In other embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks of aticaprant treatment. In further embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced after about 3 weeks to about 6 weeks, and, in certain embodiments, through week 6, of aticaprant treatment. In certain embodiments, the patient\\'s anhedonia is reduced by at least about 40%, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale following about 6 weeks of the treatment with aticaprant. In further embodiments, the anhedonia of the patient is reduced within about 3 weeks, and in some embodiments within about 3 weeks to about 6 weeks, as measured by the change from baseline in total score in an anhedonia scale and/or by physician/clinical judgement.[0045] The methods described herein were found to not only improve the patient\\'s depression and anhedonia symp\\xad toms, but resulted in fewer antidepressant side effects. Doing so resulted in less absenteeism (i.e., more visits or interac\\xad tions with physicians), greater cognitive functioning, improvements in health-related quality of life, more interest and engagement in everyday activities, improvement in family and inter-personal relationships, ability to function in the workplace, fewer hospitalizations, among others.[0046] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" refer to a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. Preferably, the patient has experienced and/or exhibited at least one symptom of the disease or disorder to be treated and/or prevented. In some embodiments, the patient is an adult. As used herein, the term \"adult\" as used herein refers to a human that is about 18 years of age or older. In certain aspects, the patient is an elderly adult, i.e., greater than or equal to 65 years of age.[0047] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the terms \"treating\", \"treatment\" and the like, shall include the man\\xad agement and care of a subject or patient (preferably mam\\xad mal, more preferably human) for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the adminis\\xad tration of a compound described herein to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, alleviate one or more of the symptoms or complications, or eliminate the disease, condition, or disorder.[0048] As used herein, the term \"depression\" (also referred to as depressive disorder) includes major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, situational depression, anhedonia, melancholic, mid-life depression, late-life depression, bipolar depression, depression due to identifiable stressors, treatment resistant depression, or combinations thereof. In certain embodi\\xad ments, the depression is major depressive disorder. In otherembodiments, the major depressive disorder is with melan\\xad cholic features or anxious distress. In further embodiments, the depression is treatment-resistant depression. In other embodiments, the depression is major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation.[0049] As known in the art, a patient is considered to have major depressive disorder if exhibiting five or more symp\\xad toms during the same two week period that are a change from previous functioning; depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure must be present; excluding symptoms clearly attributable to another medical condition. See, e.g., Table A.TABLE BDSM-5 Criteria for MDDDepressed MoodLoss of interest/pleasure (anhedonia)Weight loss or gainSleep problemsPsychomotor agitation or retardationGuilt or worthlessnessDecreased concentrationSuicidalityFatigueAt least 1At least 5TABLE ADepressed mood: Most of the day, nearly every day; may be subjective (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observed by others (e.g., appears tearful); in children and adolescents, can be irritable moodLoss of interest/pleasure: Markedly diminished interest/pleasure in all (or almost all) activities most of the day, nearly every day; may be subjective or observed by othersWeight loss or gain: Significant weight loss (without dieting) or gain (changeof >5% body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly everyday; in children, may be failure to gain weight as expectedInsomnia or hypersomnia: Nearly every dayPsychomotor agitation or retardation: Nearly every day and observable by others (not merely subjectively restless or slow)Fatigue: Or loss of energy, nearly every dayFeeling worthless or excessive/inappropriate guilt: Nearly every day; guilt may be delusional; not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sickDecreased concentration: Nearly every day; may be indecisiveness; may besubjective or observed by othersThoughts of death/suicide\" Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without specific plan, or suicide attempt, or a specific plan for suicide[0050] In some embodiments, to be diagnosed with MDD, the following criteria also are met:[0051] Major depressive disorder may be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. In some embodiments, the MDD is mild. In other embodiments, the MDD is moderate. In further embodiments, the MDD is severe. As used herein, \"mild MDD\" applies to a patient having few, if any, symp\\xadTABLE B-continuedDSM-5 Criteria for MDDSymptoms cause significant distress or impairmentNot attributable to medical conditionExclude schizophrenia disordersNo hx of mania or hypomaniaMust have all 4toms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning. The mild MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.0) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.0). \"Moderate MDD\" applies to a patient having a number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or func\\xad tional impairment are between those specified for \"mild\" and \"severe.\" The moderate MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.1) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.1). \"Severe MDD\" applies to a patient where the number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of symptoms is seriously dis\\xad tressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning, and urgent symptom control is necessary. In some embodiments, the severe MDD may be a single episode (ICD-10 F32.2) or a recurrent episode (ICD-10 F33.2). In other embodiments, MDD is classified according to the DSM-5 definition of Table B.[0052]  Several scales are known in the art that may beutilized to diagnose or monitor patients with MDD. Examples of these scales include, without limitation, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale, Symp\\xad toms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS), Self\\xad Assessment of Treatment Experience (SATE) scale, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ), i.e., MGH\\xad ATRQ.[0053] In some embodiments, MADRS is utilized to diag\\xad nose and/or monitor the patient. MADRS is a 10-item rating scale that is used in antidepressant studies. It is clinician\\xad administered and designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS scale is validated, reliable, and acceptable to regulatory health authorities as a primary scale to determine efficacy in major depression. In some embodiments, MADRS is administered using the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symp\\xad toms), sUlllilled for a total possible score of 60. Higherscores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.[0054] In other embodiments, CGI-S is utilized to diag\\xad nose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. CGI-S is a scale that rates the severity of the subject\\'s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician\\'s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis and improvement with treatment. CGI-S provides an overall clinician-deter\\xad mined summary measure of severity of subject\\'s illness that considers all available information, including knowledge of subject\\'s history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and impact of symptoms on subject\\'s ability to function. CGI-S evaluates severity of psychopathology on scale of Oto 7. Subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at time of rating according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among most extremely ill patients.[0055] In further embodiments, SMDDS is utilized to diagnose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. SMDDS is a subjective rating of the patient. The SMDDS is a 16-item PRO measure. Each item is rated by the subject according to a 5-point Likert scale. Subjects respond to each question using a rating scale between 0 (\"Not at all\" or \"Never\") to 4 (\"Extremely\" or \"Always\"). The total score ranges from 0 to 60. The SMDDS uses a 7-day recall period and verbal rating scales. Higher score indicates more severe depressive symptomatology.[0056] In yet other embodiments, SATE is utilized to diagnose and/or monitor the patient\\'s depression. SATE is a one to three questionnaire administered when the subject is unable to complete other evaluations, i.e., away from the clinical setting such as at home. SATE is useful to evaluate improvement or deterioration of depressive symptoms of the subjects over a short period of time. For rating overall depression, subject selected one option out oflmproved, not changed or got worse; for depression improvement, subject selected one option out of slightly improved, much improved, very much improved and for depression worsen subject selected slightly worse, much worse, very much worse. See, Table C.TABLE CSATE QuestionnaireQuestion 1: Since starting this study medication, overall would you say your depression is:0 Improved0 Got worse0 Not changedIf the subject selects answer 1 (Improved), following question is asked: Question 2: How much did your depression improve?0 Slightly improved0 Much improved0 Very much improvedIf the subject selects answer 3 (Got worse), following question is asked: Question 3: How much did your depression worsen?0 Slightly worse0 Much worse0 Very much worse[0057] The MGH-ATRQ is a self-rated scale used to determine treatment resistance in patient\\'s having MDD. This questionnaire examines the antidepressant treatmenthistory, using specific anchor points to define the adequacy of both dose and duration of each antidepressant trial, and the degree of symptomatic improvement. The MGH-ATRQ permits determining treatment resistance in depression and is known to those skilled in the art.[0058] In certain embodiments, the patient had an inad\\xad equate response to other antidepressant therapy (i.e., anti\\xad depressant medication or treatment used to treat depression other than aticaprant). \"Inadequate response\" as used herein refers to a patient experiencing a less than about 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. Typically, the inadequate response is during a current/active episode of the depression. In some embodiments, an inadequate response refers to a patient experiencing about 26 to less than about 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. In other embodiments, an inadequate response refers to a patient experiencing about 26 to about 49, about 26 to about 45, about 26 to about 40, about 26 to about 35,about 26 to about 30, about 30 to about 49, about 30 to about45, about 30 to about 40, about 30 to about 35, about 35 toabout 49, about 35 to about 45, about 35 to about 40, about40 to about 49, or about 40 to about 45% reduction in depressive symptom severity from the start of initiating treatment. A patient\\'s response may be measured by one or more scales described herein and/or by physician/clinical judgment. In some embodiments, an inadequate response is measured by MGH-ATRQ, MADRS, or SHAPS. In further embodiments, an inadequate response is measured by MGH\\xad ATRQ.[0059] To the extent a patient is said to have a partial response to treatment, this refers to some minor to moderate symptomatic improvement since the initiation of treatment, but some of the initial symptoms are still present and troubling to the patient and these persistent symptoms still affect behavior and function. For instance, the patient\\'s motivation, productivity, and interest in his or her usual activities may still be impaired.[0060] Antidepressant therapy refers to any pharmaceuti\\xad cal agent which can be used to treat depression. Suitable examples include, without limitation, mono-amine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, tetracyclics, non-cyclics, triazolopyri\\xad dines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), sero\\xad tonin receptor antagonists, serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic agents, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, or antipsychotics (typical or atypical antipsychotics). Examples of mono\\xad amine oxidase inhibitors include phenelzine, tranylcyprom\\xad ine, moclobemide, and the like. Examples of tricyclics include imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, nortrip\\xad tyline, doxepin, protriptyline, trimipramine, clomipramine, amoxapine, and the like. Examples of tetracyclics includes maprotiline, and the like. Examples of non-cyclics include nomifensine, and the like. Examples of triazolopyridines include trazodone, and the like. Examples of SSRis include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, and the like. Examples of sero\\xad tonin receptor antagonists include nefazadone, and the like. Examples of SNRis include venlafaxine, milnacipran, des\\xad venlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran and the like. Examples of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic agents include mirtazapine, and the like. Examples of noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors include reboxetine, edivoxetine and the like. Examples of typical antipsychotics include phenothi-azines (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, levomepromazin), thioxan\\xad thenes (e.g., thiothixene, flupentixol), butyrophenones (e.g., haloperidol), dibenzoxazepines (e.g., loxapine), dihydroin\\xad dolones (e.g., molindone), substituted benzamides (e.g., sulpride, amisulpride), and the like. Examples of atypical antipsychotics include paliperidone, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, zotepine, ziprasidone, iloperidone, perospirone, blonanserin, sertindole, ORG-5222, sonepipra\\xad zole, aripiprazole, nemonapride, SR-31742, CX-516, SC-111, NE-100, divalproate (mood stabilizer) and the like. In further embodiments, the antidepressant therapy includes natural products such as Kava-Kava, St. John\\'s Wort, and the like or dietary supplements such as s-adenosylmethio\\xad nine, and the like. In yet other embodiments, the antidepres\\xad sant therapy includes neuropeptides such as thyrotropin\\xad releasing hormone and the like or compounds targeting neuropeptide receptors such as neurokinin receptor antago\\xad nists and the like. In still further embodiments, the antide\\xad pressant therapy is a hormone such as triiodothyronine, and the like. In other embodiments, the antidepressant therapy is SSRI, SNRI, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the antidepressant is a SSRI that is escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine or citalopram. In other embodiments, the antidepressant is a SNRT that is venlafaxine, duloxetine, vortioxeine or desvenlafaxine. There are also non-pharma\\xad cologic treatments, such as psychotherapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, that are also available and options for adjunctive therapy.[0061] Therapeutically effective amounts/dosage levels and dosage regimens for the other antidepressant therapy may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, therapeutic dosage amounts and regimens for pharmaceutical agents approved for sale are publicly avail\\xad able, for example as listed on packaging labels, in standard dosage guidelines, in standard dosage references such as the Physician\\'s Desk Reference (Medical Economics Company or online at http:///www.pdrel.com) or other sources.[0062] In some embodiments, other antidepressant therapy may include one antidepressant medication. In other embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes two or more antidepressant medications. In further embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes two antidepressant medications. In yet other embodiments, other antidepressant therapy includes three antidepressant medications. The attending physician would be able to select suitable antide\\xad pressant therapies for use as described herein.[0063] In certain embodiments, the patient was receiving treatment with other antidepressant therapy prior to receiv\\xad ing aticaprant. In some embodiments, the patient was receiv\\xad ing treatment with other antidepressant therapy that com\\xad prised a SSRI, SNRI, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the patient stopped treatment with other anti\\xad depressant therapy before initiating treatment with ati\\xad caprant.[0064] Also encompassed by the methods described herein include adjunctive treatment with an effective amount of one or more antidepressants. As used herein, the term \"adjunctive treatment\" and \"adjunctive therapy\" shall mean treatment of a patient in need thereof by administering aticaprant in combination with one or more antidepressant (s), wherein aticaprant and the antidepressant(s) are admin\\xad istered by any suitable means, simultaneously, sequentially, separately, or in a single pharmaceutical formulation.[0065] In some aspects, aticaprant is administered adjunc\\xad tively with other antidepressant(s) currently being adminis\\xad tered to the patient, including current antidepressant(s) to which the patient had an inadequate response. In other embodiments, aticaprant is administered adjunctively with an antidepressant(s) not previously administered to the patient. In still other embodiments, aticaprant is adminis\\xad tered in a regimen with an antidepressant(s) previously administered to the patient.[0066] Where aticaprant and other antidepressant(s) are administered in separate dosage forms, the number of dos\\xad ages administered per day for each active compound may be the same or different and more typically different. The antidepressant may be dosed as prescribed by the attending physician and/or by its label and aticaprant is dosed as described herein. Typically, a patient is under concurrent treatment with both an antidepressant and aticaprant, where both are administered by their prescribed dosing regimens. The aticaprant and antidepressant(s) may be administered according to simultaneous or alternating regimens, at the same or different times during the course of the therapy, concurrently in divided or single forms.[0067] Aticaprant and the antidepressant(s) may be administered via the same or different routes of administra\\xad tion. Examples of suitable methods of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, intravenous (iv), intra\\xad nasal (in) intramuscular (im), subcutaneous (sc), transder\\xad mal, buccal, or rectal. In some embodiments, aticaprant is administered orally.[0068] Treatment with aticaprant as described herein has several advantages over the treatments in the art. In some embodiments, the patient does not experience many of the side effects that are associated with other antidepressants, i.e., antidepressants other than aticaprant. In certain aspects, the patient does not experience weight gain during the treatment with aticaprant. As used herein, the term \"weight gain\" refers to an increase in the weight of patient, relative to the weight of the patient before taking aticaprant or the weight of the patient that is assessed at the time of the initial administration of the aticaprant. In certain embodiments, the patient may actually see a decrease in overall weight, relative to the weight of the patient before taking aticaprant. In further embodiments, the patient\\'s weight is stable, i.e., does not increase or decrease. In certain embodiments, the patient does not experience a clinically relevant weight gain which is characterized as a weight increase of 2:7%.[0069] This is contrary to many other antidepressants where weight gain, including clinically relevant weight gain, is a common, but unfortunate, side-effect.[0070] In further aspects, the patient does not experience a decrease in sexual functioning during the treatment with aticaprant. As used herein, the term \"decrease in sexual functioning\" refers to reducing or lessening of one or more components of the human sex drive, i.e., sexual functioning. In some embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises one or more of sexual drive, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication, erection, orgasm achievement, or orgasm satisfaction. In other embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises sexual drive. In further embodiments, the sexual functioning com\\xad prises vaginal lubrication satisfaction. In further embodi\\xad ments, the sexual functioning comprises orgasm achieve\\xad ment. In yet other embodiments, the sexual functioning comprises orgasm satisfaction. Desirably, the patient\\'s sexual functioning is assessed at the time of initial admin-istration of the aticaprant. Thus, the patient\\'s sexual func\\xad tioning while taking aticaprant can be compared to the patient\\'s sexual functioning before administration of ati\\xad caprant. Sexual functioning may be assessed by using stan\\xad dard scales and techniques such as the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX). The ASEX is used to investigate whether aticaprant has a further positive or negative effect on sexual function. The ASEX is 5 item rating scale admin\\xad istered to patients that quantifies sexual drive, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication or penile erection, ability to reach orgasm and satisfaction. Scores range from 5 to 30, and two different versions of the scale are available (males and females).[0071] Other scales may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of the methods used herein to treat the patient. Examples include the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KS S), and Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS). The CPFQ is a brief self-report scale that provides additional information regarding the impact of adjunctive treatment on aspects of cognitive and executive function including atten\\xad tion, memory and mental acuity. Subjects with MDD are often reported to have difficulties with functioning in this area. The KSS is a subject-reported assessment used to rate sleepiness on a scale of 1 to 9, ranging from \"extremely alert\" (1) to \"very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep\" (9). The TEPS includes 18 items, 2 subscales designed to distinguish between anticipatory and consum\\xad matory pleasure.[0072] As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term \"aticaprant\" refers to 3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl) pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide, i.e., the follow\\xad ing compound:and is also known as JNJ-67953964, CERC-501, and LY-2456302. In some embodiments, \"aticaprant\" refers to the (S)-enantiomer of aticaprant, i.e., the following com\\xad pound:also known as (S)-aticaprant or (S)-3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5- dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide. In other embodiments, the aticaprant used in the methods described herein is substantially free of the (R)-enantiomer, i.e., (R)-aticaprant or (R)-3-fluoro-4-4-2-(3,5-dimethylphe\\xad nyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methylphenoxybenzamide having the following structure:oo---0     0NH,oF[0073] In other embodiments, the aticaprant contains less than about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In further embodiments, the aticaprant contains less than about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5, about 4, about3, about 2, about 1, about 0.5, about 0.1, about 0.005, or about 0.001% by weight, based on the weight of the ati\\xad caprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In yet other embodiments, the aticaprant contains about 0.001 to about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant. In still further embodiments, the aticaprant contains about 0.001 to about 10%, about0.001 to about 5%, about 0.001 to about 1, about 0.001 toabout 0.5, about 0.001 to about 0.1, about 0.1 to about 5,about 0.1 to about 1, about 0.1 to about 5, or about 0.5 to about 5% by weight, based on the weight of the aticaprant, of the (R)-enantiomer of aticaprant.[0074] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of aticaprant are also contemplated by the present invention, which may be readily selected by those skilled in the art. A \"pharmaceu\\xad tically acceptable salt\" refers a salt of aticaprant that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. See, generally, G.S. Paulekuhn, \"Trends in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Salt Selection based on Analysis of the Orange Book Data\\xad base\", J. Med. Chem., 2007, 50:6665-72, S. M. Berge,\"Pharmaceutical Salts\", J. Phann. Sci., 1977, 66:1-19, and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCR and VHCA, Zurich, 2002. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for administration to patients without undue toxic\\xad ity, irritation, or allergic response.[0075] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphos\\xad phates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, bromides (such as hydrobromides), iodides (such as hydroiodides ), acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzo\\xad ates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates,hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropi\\xad onates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, y-hydroxybu\\xad tyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propane\\xad sulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2- sulfonates, and mandelates.[0076] The methods described herein include administer\\xad ing an effective amount of aticaprant, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the patient. The term \"effective amount\" as used herein, means that amount of active com\\xad pound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a human that is being sought by a researcher, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of one or more of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. In some embodiments, aticaprant is utilized in an effective amount as determined by the attend\\xad ing physician. In other embodiments, other antidepressant(s) is utilized in an effective amount either separately or in combination with aticaprant.[0077] The amount of aticaprant for administration according to the methods described herein may be deter\\xad mined by one skill in the art and, unless otherwise noted, are set forth on an aticaprant free base basis.

Aticaprant was evaluated as an adjunctive therapy; there\\xad fore, eligible subjects were maintained on their SSRI/SNRT treatment without change throughout the study. At least 50% of recruited subjects had to be anhedonic (as measured by SHAPS total score;;,;20).[0172]  A. Objectives[0173] The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of aticaprant compared to placebo when administered as adjunctive treatment in subjects with MDD partially respon\\xad sive to SSRI/SNRI treatment in terms of reduction of symptoms of depression, as assessed by the change from baseline on the MADRS in non-responders during the placebo lead-in period.[0174]  The secondary objectives are:[0175] i. To evaluate the efficacy of aticaprant compared to placebo when administered as adjunctive treatment in sub\\xad jects with MDD partially responsive to SSRI/SNRI treat\\xad ment in terms of reduction of symptoms of depression, as assessed by the change from baseline on the MADRS in both responders and non-responders during the placebo lead-in period.[0176] ii. To investigate the overall safety and tolerability of treatment with adjunctive aticaprant in subjects with MDD when used in combination with a SSRI or SNRI. [0177] iii. To investigate the effect of aticaprant versus placebo on depression related anhedonia as assessed by theSHAPS.[0178] iv. To investigate the effect of aticaprant on symp\\xad toms of depression using the Clinical Global Impression\\xad Severity (CGI-S), the patient reported Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS) and the self-assess\\xad ment of treatment experience (SATE).[0179] v. To investigate the effect of aticaprant on symp\\xad toms of anxiety using the HAM-A and on core symptoms of anxiety using the HAM-A6 subscale.[0180] vi. To assess the plasma PK of aticaprant in sub\\xad jects with MDD and explore its relationship with efficacy and safety parameters.[0181]  Secondary exploratory objectives include:[0182] i. To explore the effect of aticaprant on aspects of cognitive and executive function using the CPFQ.[0183] ii. To explore mood-related biomarkers (including but not limited to growth factors, HPAaxis markers, immune system activation, metabolic markers) and genetic/epigen\\xad etic variation that may be related to clinical response, nonresponse, or safety and tolerability parameters of ati\\xad caprant.[0184]  B. Study Design[0185] For each subject, the study consisted of two phases: a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a double-blind treatment phase lasting 11 weeks. See, FIG. 1.[0186] Subjects with MDD who have had treatment initi\\xad ated with a permitted SSRI/SNRI and have had an inad\\xad equate or only partial response to this treatment were screened. Assessments include the MINI, Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (TRQ), and MADRS. [0187] The treatment phase consisted of 3 periods. A placebo lead-in period of concealed duration, after whichsubjects entered the double-blind treatment period when they were randomly assigned to 10 mg aticaprant (two 5 mg capsules) or continue placebo for 6 weeks. Each capsule contained aticaprant (5 mg), microcrystalline cellulose (94. 95 mg), and magnesium stearate (0.05 mg) in a hard gelatin capsule. Subjects who completed the treatment period, entered the withdrawal period and were treated with placebo for the remaining time of the treatment phase. The total duration for each subject was approximately 16 weeks. There were 11 scheduled visits, including screening. An overall flow diagram is shown in FIG. 1.[0188] Subjects were screened within 35 to 2 days prior to Day 1 to ascertain their eligibility per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The symptoms of depression were assessed using the structured interview guide for the MADRS.[0189]  Double-Blind Treatment Phase[0190] The duration of the double-blind treatment phase was 11 weeks divided into 3 periods. The subject received medication after completion of the visit on Day 1. The first dose was taken at home on Day 2. All medication was taken in fasting condition. At Visits 3, 4 and 5, the subjects were re-randomized to blind subjects the duration of the placebo lead-in period. During the double-blind phase, the subjects visited the center for out-patient visits every 1 to 2 weeks.

Subjects remained blinded to exact timing of the randomization, response criterion and drug treatment assignment for each subject. [0193] Withdrawal period: Subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period prior to the end of Week 11 entered the withdrawal period where they were treated with placebo for the remaining time of the treatment phase. [0194] C. Dosage and Administration[0195] Aticaprant was supplied as 5-mg capsules. Placebo was supplied as matching capsules. All subjects took 2 capsules QD. The capsules were taken daily from Day 2 to Day 78 in fasting condition with some water (fasting for at least 4 hours before dosing). Medication was taken before breakfast. If the subject has forgotten to take the medication before breakfast, this was done before the next following meal, at the latest at dinner of the same day. If the subject remembered later than dinner, the dose of that day was omitted, and the subject took the dose before breakfast on the next day.[0196] When Visit 11 was planned up to 3 days later, the subject continued medication until Visit 11.[0197] The capsules were swallowed whole and not chewed, divided, dissolved or crushed. After having taken the medication, subjects did not to eat or drink for at least 30 minutes.[0198] The first dose was taken in fasting condition on Day 2 of the double-blind phase. The dose of the medication was:[0199]  10 mg aticaprant: 2 capsules of 5 mg aticaprant[0200]  Placebo: 2 placebo capsules.[0201] Medication dose was adjusted as needed to 5 mg QD based on the results of a blinded review of the safety data. When a dose reduction has been decided on, this only applied to new subjects and the dose of medication was:[0202]  5 mg aticaprant: 1 capsule of 5 mg aticaprant[0203]  Placebo: 1 placebo capsule.[0204] As used herein, the Enriched ITT Analysis Set (eITT) is defined as all enrolled lead-in placebo non-re\\xad sponders who were randomized into a treatment period, received at least one dose of study medication in the treatment period and have at least one post-baseline MADRS assessment during the treatment period. Similarly, the Full ITT Analysis Set (fITT) is defined as all enrolled subjects who were randomized into a treatment period, received at least one dose of study medication in the treatment period and have at least one post-treatment base\\xad line assessment of MADRS during the treatment period.

Clinical assessments[0206] (i) Depression: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression-Sever\\xad ity (CGI-S), Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS), and Self-assessment of treatment experience (SATE)[0207] (ii) Anhedonia: Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)[0208] (iii) Anxiety: Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety scale (SIGH-A) and HAM-A6[0209] (iv) Effects on Cognition: The Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ)[0210]  (v) Safety assessments[0211] Standard safety assessments including physical and neurological examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis was performed. Based on observations of GI complaints in previous studies, a panel including PGI, PGII, G17 and Hp IgG was added to the clinical laboratory test panel to test for stomach mucosa status.[0212]  (vi) Suicidal ideation: C-SSRS[0213]  (vii) Exploratory: CPFQ[0214] (viii) Central sedating effects: Karolinska Sleepi\\xad ness Scale[0215]  (ix) Sexual dysfunction: ASEX[0216]  E. Patient Population[0217] Of 184 subjects, 169 were randomized into the treatment period and included in the safety population, while166 subjects were considered for the full ITT population. Out of the 166 subjects in the full ITT population, 121 (73%) were lead-in placebo non-responders (enriched ITT popula\\xad tion) and the remaining 45 (27%) were lead-in placebo responders. Of the 121 subjects in the enriched population,TABLE 2-continuedSummary of Demographics and BaselineCharacteristics; Full Safety Analysisaticaprant112 (92.6%) were white and 84 (69.4%) were female.

Evaluations of Efficacy[0219] At the end of the lead-in period, response status of the subjects was assessed according to the double-blind response criteria based on reduction in MADRS relative to lead-in baseline. Both lead-in placebo responders and lead\\xad in placebo non-responders were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either aticaprant or placebo in the treatment period. The randomization was stratified by lead-in response status (non-responders: <30% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score at the end of the lead-in period vs responders: 2:30% reduction from baseline at the end of the lead-in period) and presence/absence of anhedonia (presence defined as SHAPS total score2:20).[0220] Treatment duration: The study consisted of two periods: a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a double\\xad blind treatment phase of 11 weeks. The double-blind treat-ment phase of the trial consisted of 3 periods. The first period was a placebo lead-in of 3 weeks, after which subjects entered the treatment period when they were ran\\xad domly assigned to aticaprant or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects who successfully completed the treatment period were treated with placebo during a 2-week with\\xad drawal period, i.e., Period 3. The total duration for each subject was approximately 16 weeks.[0221] Primary analysis set for efficacy: The efficacy analysis is based on the eITT set defined as all enrolled lead-in placebo non-responders who were randomized into the treatment period, received at least one dose of medica\\xad tion, and have at least one post-baseline MADRS assess\\xad ment during the treatment period. The primary analysis set is used for all efficacy endpoints.[0222] Secondary analysis set for efficacy: A secondary analysis set is the f!TT set defined as all enrolled subjects who were randomized into the treatment period, received at least one dose of medication, and have at least one post\\xad baseline MADRS assessment during the treatment period. The secondary analysis set is used for all efficacy endpoints to examine the effect in the general population, which may be useful for designing subsequent studies in the develop\\xad ment program.[0223] Analysis set for safety: The safety analysis is based on the full safety analysis set, defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of medication in the treatment period.[0224] The efficacy endpoints were presented for both the eITT and the f!TT.[0225] Level of significance: The analysis of primary efficacy endpoint was performed at a significance level of0.20 (one-sided). The analysis of secondary efficacy end\\xad points was performed at a significance level of 0.20 (two\\xad sided). No adjustment for multiple comparisons was per\\xad formed.[0226]  F. Results[0227] (i) Primary Endpoint: Change from Treatment Baseline in MADRS Total Score at Treatment Week 6 in Non-Responders during Placebo Lead-in Period[0228]  Enriched ITT Analysis Set[0229] The mean (SD) MADRS total score at treatment baseline was 29.0 (4.61), ranging from 19 to 41. See, FIG.2. The mean change from treatment baseline (SD) in MADRS total score at treatment week 6 was -10.2 (8.44) for aticaprant and -8.2 (8.53) for placebo. The observed effect size was 0.23.

See, FIGS. 17A and 17B. In FIG. 17A, i.e., the high anhedonia group, the placebo+oral antidepressant group shows less placebo response as compared to the low anhedonia group in FIG. 17B. Similarly the treatment effect of the aticaprant+lead in phase followed by a double-blind phase. Patients who responded to placebo during the lead in phase were labelled as non-responders. Patients who did not respond to placebo were labelled as non-responders. The double-blind treatment phase then continued for an additional 6 weeks, after which patients entered a withdrawal period.[0280] Of the 121 subjects in the enriched population (60 in aticaprant and 61 in placebo group), 117 (96.7%) com\\xad pleted the study. The overall completion rate for the full ITT analysis set is 95%. This contrasts with completion rates of approximately 85% for studies of adjunctive aripiprazole (Pae, CNS Drugs, 2011; 25, 109-127) and 45-62% foradjunctive quetiapine (El Khalili cited above). In total 4 subjects (3.3%) discontinued the study: 2 subjects in placebo and 2 subjects in aticaprant treatment group. See, Tables 30 and 31.TABLE 30oral antidepressant group is higher in the high anhedoniagroup as compared to the low anhedonia group. Overall the effect size is larger at every single time point (from week 1onwards) in the high anhedonia group. The LSMD in theCompletion/Early Witbdrawal Information; e!TT Analysis Setaticapranthigh anhedonia group is more than double that of the low anhedonia group at week 6. Further, when looking at thePlacebo(N- 61)10 mg(N - 60)Total (N - 121)symptom level, greater improvement in items related to anhedonia and dysphoria in subgroup with high anhedonia vs low anhedonia. See, FIG. 18.[0276]  (v) Weight Change[0277] At the lead-in baseline timepoint, the mean weight for subjects in the placebo group was 76.17 kg compared to78.66 in the aticaprant group. After 6 weeks in the double\\xad blind treatment phase, the mean weight in the placebo group was 75.75 kg compared to 78.57 kg in the aticaprant group.

Major depres\\xad sion itself is associated with increased sexual dysfunction, and many of the pharmacological treatments are known to worsen sexual functioning even further. In a large survey of nearly 5000 patients in France, it was estimated that in untreated patients with MDD, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction was 65%. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction increased to 71% for patients treated with antidepressant therapy.[0283] Sexual pleasure is an important component of hedonic tone. The brain reward circuitry is controlled by several areas: nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. It is hypothesized that treatment with kappa opioid receptors may restore the normal homeostatic balance in patients with overactivation. Treatment with aticaprant could potentially improve symptoms of anhedo\\xad nia. Other symptoms associated with the reward circuitry includes: sexual pleasure, lack of interest and lack of enjoy\\xad ment.[0284] Patients had their sexual functioning measured using a standard, well accepted rating scale: ASEX. See, Table 32.TABLE 32ASEX scores by treatment groupPlaceboAticaprantn - 84n - 85Baseline22.0421.26Endpoint21.3619.79Absolute Change-0.68-1.47Relative % Change-3.09%-6.91%[0285] The mean change from treatment baseline (SD) in ASEX total score to week 6 was -1.5 (4.02) points for aticaprant compared to -0.7 (2.98) points for placebo. A lower score on the ASEX indicates improvement. The score reduction at week 6 was greater in the aticaprant group compared to placebo. This is unexpected because adjunctivetory pleasure: orgasm satisfying, reach orgasm and vaginal lubrication/erection. Most of the improvements seen in items 3, 4 and 5 of FIG. 20.[0287]  (viii) Onset of Effect[0288] The onset of effect for aticaprant can be estimated from the study. FIG. 7B depicts the least squares mean change from baseline. A significant treatment effect favoring aticaprant was seen as early as week 3. At this point, aticaprant showed a statistically superior effect compared to placebo.Example 2: Single Dose Aticaprant as Adjunctive Antidepressant Therapy[0289] Study Design: A 6-week, multicenter, double\\xad blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aticaprant in adult and elderly subjects (18 to 74 years) who have MDD with prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH+), and who have had an inadequate response to a SSRI or a serotonin and SNRI in the current depressive episode. See, FIG. 21.[0290] For all subjects, this study will consist of 3 phases: an eligibility screening phase (up to 4 weeks prior to first dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase of 6 weeks, and a follow-up of 1-2 weeks. Subjects who have completed the double-blind phase may participate in an open-label long-term safety study.[0291] Sample Size and Randomization: Approximately 544 subjects with MDD with prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH+) and without prominent anhedonia (MDD ANH-) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adjunctive placebo or aticaprant to achieve a minimum of 314 adult subjects meeting predefined criteria for MDD ANH+ eligible to be included in the primary analysis.

The primary objective was to assess the reduction of depression symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), in non-responders during the placebo lead-in period. Secondary objectives included evaluating the efficacy of aticaprant in both responders and non-responders, investigating its safety and tolerability, and its effect on depression-related anhedonia, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and plasma PK of aticaprant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study design consisted of a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a double-blind treatment phase of 11 weeks. Subjects with MDD who had an inadequate or partial response to SSRI/SNRI treatment were screened. The treatment phase consisted of 3 periods: a placebo lead-in period, a double-blind treatment period where subjects were randomly assigned to 10 mg aticaprant or placebo for 6 weeks, and a withdrawal period where subjects were treated with placebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study included 184 subjects, of which 169 were randomized into the treatment period and included in the safety population. All subjects had anhedonia at treatment baseline. The primary analysis set for efficacy was based on the Enriched ITT Analysis Set (eITT), defined as all enrolled lead-in placebo non-responders who were randomized into the treatment period, received at least one dose of study medication, and have at least one post-baseline MADRS assessment during the treatment period.The patent discusses a method for treating depression using a compound called aticaprant. The method was tested using different analysis sets for efficacy and safety. The primary analysis set was used for all efficacy endpoints, while a secondary analysis set was used to examine the effect in the general population. The safety analysis was based on the full safety analysis set, which included all subjects who received at least one dose of medication in the treatment period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results showed a significant positive efficacy signal for aticaprant versus placebo at the one-sided 0.20 significance level. The treatment effect was larger in the full ITT (fITT) than in the enriched ITT (eITT) population. The mean change from treatment baseline in MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) total score at treatment week 6 was -10.2 for aticaprant and -8.2 for placebo in the eITT population, and -9.7 for aticaprant and -6.6 for placebo in the fITT population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the primary efficacy assessment. A supplementary analysis was conducted using all the data collected prior to 15 Mar. 2020, and the results corroborated the findings of the primary efficacy analysis in both eITT and fITT populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The secondary endpoints included MADRS remission rates, response rates (at least 30% improvement), and changes in SHAPS (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale) total score from treatment baseline to treatment week 6. The results showed significant treatment differences at treatment week 6 for both populations.The patent discusses a study on the effects of the drug aticaprant on patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The study used a model with subject as a random effect, country, treatment, time, and time-by-treatment interaction as factors, and baseline SHAPS total score as a continuous covariate. The results showed that aticaprant had a greater effect on patients with high anhedonia levels compared to those with low anhedonia levels. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events during the treatment phase were headache and diarrhea. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest during the treatment period were diarrhea and pruritus. The study concluded that segmentation into high vs low anhedonia had a benefit for treating MDD, with a higher treatment effect for Aticaprant.The patent discusses a study on the use of aticaprant as an adjunctive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with prominent anhedonia. The study involved a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with adult and elderly subjects who had an inadequate response to a SSRI or a serotonin and SNRI in the current depressive episode. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study found that aticaprant had a larger treatment effect in patients with more anhedonia at baseline. The weight of the subjects in both the placebo and aticaprant groups remained relatively stable over the 6-week treatment period, which was unexpected as other adjunctive treatments for MDD usually result in a mean weight increase. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study also found that patients receiving aticaprant had notable improvements in sexual functioning, with the greatest changes seen in items related to consummatory pleasure. A significant treatment effect favoring aticaprant was seen as early as week 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study had a high completion rate, with 96.7% of the 121 subjects in the enriched population completing the study. This contrasts with completion rates of approximately 85% for studies of adjunctive aripiprazole and 45-62% for adjunctive quetiapine. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also outlines the design for a future study involving approximately 544 subjects with MDD with and without prominent anhedonia. The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to adjunctive placebo or aticaprant. The study will consist of 3 phases: an eligibility screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase of 6 weeks, and a follow-up of 1-2 weeks.The patent discusses a study involving the use of aticaprant as an adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant in adult subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and inadequate response to the current antidepressant. The study includes specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, such as a history of treatment-resistant MDD, current or prior diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, and history of moderate to severe substance use disorder, among others. \n",
      "\n",
      "The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of aticaprant in improving depressive symptoms, as assessed by the change from baseline in the MADRS total score from Day 1 to the end of the 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Secondary objectives include assessing the efficacy of aticaprant on patient-reported assessment of anhedonia outcomes and other depressive symptoms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also outlines safety objectives, including the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, ECG, laboratory values, weight/BMI, suicidality assessment using the C-SSRS, and withdrawal symptoms assessment using the PWC-20. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also specifies that all subjects will continue their baseline antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI) during the entire study, and lists prohibited therapies that subjects must not use prior to or during the study.This patent describes a method for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) in a human patient with anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) using a drug called aticaprant. The patient should have had an inadequate response to other antidepressant therapy prior to treatment with aticaprant. The effective amount of aticaprant is less than about 60 mg.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also describes a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fixed doses of aticaprant 5 mg and 10 mg as adjunctive therapy in adult and elderly subjects with MDD with prominent anhedonia and inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy. The study will consist of an eligibility screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase of 8 weeks, and a follow-up phase of 1-2 weeks. Approximately 624 subjects will be enrolled in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent also lists a number of prohibited therapies during the study, including antipsychotic drugs, hypnotic drugs, non-SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, new psychotherapy, opiates and mood stabilizers, stimulants, magnetic and electrical stimulation therapies, thyroid hormone supplementation for depression, ketamine or esketamine, psychedelics, memantine, and other investigational drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent claims include methods for treating MDD with anhedonia using aticaprant, where the patient had an inadequate response to other antidepressant therapy. The effective amount of aticaprant is less than about 60 mg, and it can be administered orally and once daily. The patient may also be treated with one or more other antidepressants. The patent also claims methods where the patient has mild, moderate, severe, or prominent anhedonia.\n"

claims the benefit of priority of United States provisional patent application Serial No. 62/738,333 filed September 28, 2018, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.\\n\\n[0002] The present disclosure relates to compositions, and their application as pharmaceuticals for treating disorders ameliorated by activating muscarinic receptors in a human or animal subject.\\n\\n[0003] Schizophrenia affects about 0.5 to J % of the population. The disease is characterized by a set of symptorns divided into positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thoughts, etc.), negative symptoms (e.g., social isolation, anhedonia, etc.), and cognitive symptoms (e.g., inability to process information, poor working memory, etc.). Patients who suffer from schizophrenia experience a major decline in quality oflife and are at increased risk for mortality due to many factors, such as an increased suicide rate. The cost of schizophrenia to society is high, as sufferers of schizophrenia are much more likely to be incarcerated, homeless or unemployed.\\n\\n[0004] Existing treatments for schizophrenia rely upon dopamine and serotonin receptors, as was the case \\'.vith the first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, discovered in 1952. For more than 60 years, the same fundamental pharmacology has been the standard of care in schizophrenia. Current antipsychotics are only efficacious toward positive symptoms, leaving negative and co1:,111itive symptoms untreated. Alzheimer\\'s disease is another therapeutic area in which it has proven extremely difficult to develop ne\\\\v therapies, \\\\Vith a success rate of only 0.4% for molecules that enter clinical development and receive marketing approval. New treatments are desperately needed by patients in these areas, but development has been extremely difficult despite substantial efforts from scientists and drug developers around the world. [0005] Activating the muscarinic system through muscarinic agonists may treat several diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\\'s disease, Parkinson\\'s disease, depression, movement disorders, drug addiction. pain, and neurodegeneration, such as tauopathies or synucleinopathies. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors with five different receptor sub1-y pes (Ml-M5), each of which is found in the CNS with different tissue distributions. MI and M4 subtypes have been of interest as therapeutic targets for various diseases. For instance, the mood stabilizers lithium and valproic acid, used for treating\\n\\nbipolar depression, may exert their effects via the muscarinic system particularly through the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91) - ISA/US\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nM4 subtype receptor. Genetic evidence directly links the muscarinic system and alcohol addiction.\\n\\n[0006] In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenic patients using xanomeline, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist with preferential activity at the Ml and M4 subtype receptors, schizophrenia was alleviated. However, because xanomeline also bound to muscarinic receptors outside the brain, many serious side effects resulted, including GI side effects, cardiac side effects and hypersalivation. Dose-limited adverse events were problematic and led to very high discontinuation rates (including a 56% dropout rate in a 26- week study of Alzheimer\\'s disease) and eventually to discontinuation of xanomeline development. Despite the early promise, xanomeline development halted for more than 15 years. Many companies attempted and failed to develop muscarinic receptor agonists for CNS disorders which avoided these unacceptable side effects, but no such agonist has reached the market. Past development efforts focused on medicinal chemistry to develop molecules that would be more tolerable, typically by selecting for the Ml and M4 subtypes over the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes. However, Ml and/or M4 activation outside the brain may still cause muscarinic related intolerance. Very little progress has been made to mitigate adverse effects due to the activation of peripheral muscarinic receptors. [0007] There remains a need in the art for a pharmaceutical composition with increased tolerability for xanomeline, especially to treat cognitive and psychotic disorders. The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated with compositions and methods, which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope.

The broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with laws or regulations defining patentable subject matter is intended. In jurisdictions that do not forbid the patenting of methods practiced on the human body, the \"administering\" of compositions includes both methods practiced on the human body and the foregoing activities.\\n\\n[0091] The term \"therapeutic agent\" is art-recognized and refers to any chemical moiety that is a biologically, physiologically, or pharmacologically active substance acting locally or systemically in a subject. Examples of therapeutic agents, also referred to as \"drugs,\" are described in well-known literature references such as the Merck Index (14th edition), the Physicians\\' Desk Reference (64th edition), and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (12th edition). These therapeutic agents include without limitation medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of a disease or illness; substances that affect the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a physiological environment.\\n\\n[0092] The term \"psychotherapy\" refers to non-pharmacological therapies in which those skilled in the art use a variety of techniques involving verbal and other interactions with a patient to affect a positive therapeutic outcome.

Diseases include, but are not limited to, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), Dubowitz Syndrome, FG Syndrome, Down\\'s Syndrome, growth delay due to insulin-like growth factor I (IGFl) deficiency, hepatic encephalopathy syndrome, and Strauss Syndrome.\\n\\n[0099] The term \"addictive disorders\" refers to diseases or conditions marked by addiction or substance dependence as defined by the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual V (DSM-5). Such disorders are characterized by physical dependence, withdrawal and tolerance to a substance. Such substances include but are not limited to alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, inhalants, nicotine, barbiturates, cocaine and cannabis. Addictive disorders also encompass behaviors that a patient does compulsively or continually despite clear negative consequences. For instance, ludomania (gambling addiction, or compulsive gambling) is recognized by those skilled in the art as being an addictive behavior that often has devastating consequences. In certain embodiments, the addictive behavior may be Internet Gaming Disorder (gaming addiction), as defined in the DSM-5.\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0100] The term \"pain\" refers to physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury. Pain is a subjective experience and the perception of pain is performed parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Usually noxious (peripheral) stimuli are transmitted to the CNS beforehand, but pain is not always associated with nociception. A broad variety of clinical pain exists, derived from different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and needing different treatment approaches. Three major types of clinical pain have been characterized: acute pain, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain.\\n\\n[0101] Acute clinical pain may result, for example, from inflammation or soft tissue injury. This type of pain is adaptive and has the biologically relevant function of warning and enabling healing and repair of an already damaged body part to occur undisturbed. A protective function is achieved by making the injured or inflamed area and surrounding tissue hypersensitive to all stimuli so that contact with any external stimulus can be avoided. The neuronal mechanisms underlying this type of clinical pain are well understood and pharmacological control of acute clinical pain is available and effective, for example by means of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) up to opioids depending on type and extent of the sensation of pain.\\n\\n[0102] Chronic clinical pain appears as sustained sensory abnormalities resulting from an ongoing peripheral pathology such as cancer or chronic inflammation (e.g., arthritis) or it can be independent of such initiating triggers. Chronic pain independent of initiating triggers is maladaptive, offering no survival advantage, and very often no effective treatment is available.\\n\\n[0103] Neuropathic pain can be classified as peripheral or central. Peripheral neuropathic pain is caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves, whereas central neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the CNS or/and the spinal cord. Both peripheral and central neuropathic pain can occur without obvious initial nerve damage.\\n\\n[0104] The term \"activator\" means a molecule described as an agonist, partial agonist, co\\xad agonist, physiological agonist, potentiator, stimulator, allosteric potentiator, positive allosteric modulator, allosteric agonist, or a molecule that increases the activity or signaling of receptors directly or indirectly.\\n\\n[0105] The term \"inhibitor\" means a molecule described as an antagonist, partial antagonist, competitive antagonist, non-competitive antagonist, uncompetitive antagonist, silent antagonist, inverse agonist, reversible antagonist, physiological antagonist, irreversible antagonist, inhibitor, reversible inhibitor, irreversible inhibitor, negative allosteric modulator,\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nallosteric antagonist, or a molecule that decreases the activity or signaling of receptors directly or indirectly.\\n\\n[0106] The term \"maximum tolerated dose\" means the highest dose of a drug or therapeutic that a patient can take without the patient experiencing intolerable side effects. The maximum tolerated dose is typically determined empirically in clinical trials.\\n\\n[0107] The term \"muscarinic receptors\" refers to G-protein linked receptors that bind the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. To date, five subtypes of muscarinic receptor have been identified. \"Ml\" means the subtype one muscarinic receptor. \"M2\" means the subtype two muscarinic receptor. \"M3\" means the subtype three muscarinic receptor. \"M4\" means the subtype four muscarinic receptor. \"MS\" means the subtype five muscarinic receptor.\\n\\n[0108] The term \"antipsychotic\" refers to a drug that diminishes psychosis, hallucinations or delusions. Antipsychotics include, but are not limited to haloperidol, droperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine, mesoridazine, periciazine, promazine, triflupromazine, levomepromazine, promethazine, pimozide, chlorprothixene, flupenthixol, thiothixene, zuclopenthixol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, amisulpride, asenapine, paliperidone, zotepine, aripiprazole, bifeprunox, and tetrabenazine.\\n\\n[0109] The term \"anxiolytics\" refers to drugs that reduce anxiety, fear, panic or related feelings. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam), buspirone, barbiturates (e.g., amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbitol), and hydroxyzine.\\n\\n[0110] The term \"anti-depressants\" refers to drugs that alleviate depression and related conditions (e.g., dysthymia). Such drugs include, but are not limited to, selective serotonin\\xad reuptake inhibitors (SSRls, e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRls, e.g., desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipram, venlafaxine), mianserin, mirtazapin, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., atomoxetine, mazindol, reboxetine, viloxazine), bupropion, tianeptine, agomelatine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). [0111] The terms \"sedatives\" or \"tranquilizers\" refer to drugs that induce somnolence, promote a feeling of being tired or desire to sleep, or promote a state of unconsciousness.\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch drugs include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines, barbiturates (e.g., amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbitol), eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone.\\n\\nPharmaceutical Compositions\\n\\n[0112] Earlier development of xanomeline, a muscarinic receptor agonist, as a monotherapy was halted due to peripheral cholinergic side effects. The current disclosure provides a dosage form with dissolution kinetics having a more effective therapeutic effect for both active ingredients, enhanced pharmacokinetics for trospium chloride, and greater dosing compliance. The current disclosure also provides dosage forms with different strengths and/or different ratios of the two actives.\\n\\n[0113] Provided herein is an oral pharmaceutical composition, comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads comprising xanomeline or a salt thereof; and a plurality of trospium beads comprising a salt of trospium. In certain embodiments, the plurality of xanomeline beads have a core comprising xanomeline or a salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the plurality of trospium beads have a core comprising a trospium salt.\\n\\n[0114] In certain embodiments, a capsule shell comprising hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) containing separate populations of drug beads containing xanomeline tartrate or trospium chloride wherein the drug beads are of comparable size and release the actives rapidly and at substantially similar rates. Following dissolution of the capsule shell in the stomach, the drug beads may dissolve in the stomach and/or pass through the pyloric valve into the duodenum intact or partially intact, but the ratio of the two drugs, both in dissolved form and in undissolved form remains relatively constant in the gastrointestinal tract until the drugs are absorbed.\\n\\n[0115] The formulation for each drug bead allows substantially similar performance from two actives at different dose ranges, where the actives are released into the blood serum at substantially similar rates and/or achieve a substantially similar Tmax. In certain embodiments, a capsule containing 50 mg xanomeline as the tartrate salt and 10 mg trospium chloride.\\n\\nBecause 50 mg xanomeline as free base corresponds to about 76 mg xanomeline tartrate, the ratio of the active ingredients in such a formulation is about 7.6 to 1.\\n\\n[0116] A discrepancy in the number of drug beads in the capsule increases the probability that the ratio of drug beads would not remain substantially constant after the beads are released and disperse. Thus, in certain embodiments, the trospium beads are formulated with a lower drug load such that effective doses of trospium and of xanomeline are contained in roughly equivalent numbers of beads. In certain embodiments, despite the differences in drug\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nloads, the trospium and xanomeline beads release at roughly similar rates.

In certain embodiments, the beads might be coated with a pH-sensitive coating so that they do not dissolve in the low pH of the stomach. A nonfunctional coating might be used to maintain chemical separation between the beads or for cosmetic reasons.\\n\\n[0147] In a further embodiment, the controlled release formulation comprises a semi\\xad permeable coating. The xanomeline and trospium chloride may be in different coatings in the same formulation. In another embodiment, the xanomeline and trospium chloride can be in different coatings in different formulations or dosing vehicles. In a further embodiment, the semi-permeable coating comprises a polymer. In a further embodiment, the controlled release formulation comprises a matrix that suspends the xanomeline and trospium chloride.\\n\\n[0148] In certain embodiments, the distribution of coating thicknesses can be stated in weight gain of coating material based on the total weight of the coated beads. Thus, in one embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 2% based on the total weight of the coated beads. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 3%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 4%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 5%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 6%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 7%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 8%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 9%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 10%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 11%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 12%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 13%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 14%.\\n\\n[0149] For example, the difference in coating thickness from bead to bead can be in a range of+/- 1-7% based on the total weight of the coated beads. The distribution of coating thicknesses can between about 2% and about 14% based on the weight of the coated beads, such as between about 3% and about 13%, between about 4% and about 12%, between about 5% and about 11%, between about 6% to about 10%, between about 7% and 9%, between\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout 3% and 14%, between about 4% and 14%, between about 4% and 13%, or between 4%\\n\\nand about 12%.\\n\\n[0150] In one embodiment, the absorption (area under the curve, AUC) of the dosage form when dosed orally is advantageously increased, compared to other dosage forms of xanomeline or trospium chloride. Without intending to be bound by any theory, the increase in absorption is influenced by the dosage form exhibiting a pseudo-extended release profile. The pseudo-extended release profile is influenced by one or more factors, including a distribution of coating thicknesses when present, a distribution of bead particle sizes, and the beads having irregular bead shapes. For example, in an embodiment wherein the beads have a distribution of coating thicknesses, for beads with a relatively thin coating, the coating completely dissolves at the trigger pH relatively quickly to release the xanomeline and/or trospium chloride compositions, whereas for beads having a relatively thick coating the coating takes somewhat longer to completely dissolve and release the xanomeline and/or trospium chloride compositions. In an embodiment where the beads have a distribution of particle sizes and/or irregular bead shapes, the gut transit time of the beads could be varied due to bead size and/or shape, such that the transit time until reaching the coating dissolution pH is varied, thus contributing to a pseudo-extended release profile. In another embodiment, the dosage form exhibits substantially equivalent (e.g., bioequivalent) Crnax and/or AUC characteristics when administered orally inside a capsule shell or without a capsule shell. [0151] In certain embodiments, the dosage form provides a progressive and predictable absorption curve. In one embodiment, the Tmax of the dosage form when dosed orally is more stable on a dose-to-dose basis, because the beads are individually coated. A predictable, consistent Tmax is advantageous for accomplishing a more consistent, sustained therapeutic effect. For example, process-related variations in coating thickness or other influences on coating dissolution affect only a fraction of the xanomeline and trospium chloride in the dosage form and tend to lead to the pseudo-extended release behavior. In contrast, coated capsules comprising xanomeline and trospium chloride microspheres exhibits significant variability in absorption time from capsule to capsule.\\n\\n[0152] In certain embodiments, the oral pharmaceutical composition comprises xanomeline and/or a salt thereof and trospium chloride for treating a muscarinic disorder in a patient in need thereof, which when administered to the patient in need thereof, the composition is sufficient to provide an in-vivo plasma profile comprising a median Tmax for xanomeline of 2 hours and a median Tmax for trospium of 1 hour. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprofile further comprises a mean dose-normalized Crnax of between 48.5 and 121.3 pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized Crnax of trospium of between 156 and 375 pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized AUCo-12 ofxanomeline of between 263 and 577 hr·pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized AUCo-12 of trospium of between 881 and 2024 hr·pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean Crnax of trospium at 7850 ± 3360 pg/mL. In certain embodiments, the in\\xad vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean AUCo-12 of 41900 ± 15500 hr·pg/mL.\\n\\n[0153] In another embodiment, the dosage form exhibits advantageous storage stability, e.g. as measured by the amount of xanomeline present following storage and/or by the total amount of related substances. The storage stability can be assessed following storage at typical ambient conditions (e.g. 25 °C and 60% relative humidity) or at accelerated stability conditions involving increased temperature and/or humidity.\\n\\n[0154] The dosage form and methods are contemplated to include embodiments of any combination of one or more of the additional optional elements, features, and steps further described below (including those shown in the figures and Examples), unless stated otherwise. Reference to a bead and properties thereof apply equally to a collection of beads (e.g., a plurality of such beads). Likewise, reference to a core and properties thereof apply equally to a collection of cores (e.g., a plurality of such cores).\\n\\n[0155] The enteric (gastro-resistant) coating material, e.g. polymer, can be one that will dissolve in intestinal juices at a pH level higher than that of the stomach, e.g. a pH of greater than 4.5, such as within the small intestine, and therefore permit release of the active substance in the regions of the small intestine and substantially not in the upper portion of the GI tract. In one embodiment, the enteric material begins to dissolve in an aqueous solution at pH between about 4.5 and about 5.5. In another embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves in an aqueous solution at pH between of about 5. In another embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves in an aqueous solution at pH between of about 5.5.\\n\\n[0156] For example, pH-sensitive materials do not significantly dissolve until the dosage form has emptied from the stomach. The pH of the small intestine gradually increases from about 4.5 to about 6.5 in the duodenal bulb to about 7.2 in the distal portions of the small intestine (ileum). To provide predictable dissolution corresponding to the small intestine transit time of about 3 hours (e.g., 2-3 hours) and permit reproducible release therein, the\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncoating should begin to dissolve within the pH range of the duodenum, and continue to dissolve at the pH range within the small intestine. Therefore, the amount (thickness) of enteric coating should be sufficient to be substantially dissolved during the about three-hour transit time within the small intestine (e.g., the proximal and mid-small intestine).\\n\\n[0157] Suitable enteric (gastro-resistant) materials include, but are not limited to, cross\\xad linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone; non-crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone; hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate succinate; cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate; starch acetate phthalate; polyvinyl acetate phthalate; carboxymethyl cellulose; methyl cellulose phthalate; methyl cellulose succinate; methyl cellulose phthalate succinate; methyl cellulose phthalic acid half ester; ethyl cellulose succinate; carboxymethylamide; potassium methacrylate divinylbenzene copolymer; polyvinyl alcohols; polyoxyethylene glycols; polyethylene glycol; sodium alginate; galactomannan; carboxypolymethylene; sodium carboxymethyl starch; copolymers of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid with a monomer selected from the following: methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, decyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, or octadecyl acrylate, e.g. Eudragit™ -Land -S series, including L 100-55, L 30 D-55, L 100, S 100, L 12.5, and S 12.5, available from Evonik Industries; polyvinyl acetate; fats; oils; waxes; fatty alcohols; shellac; zein; gluten; ethylacrylate-maleic acid anhydride copolymer; maleic acid anhydride-vinyl methyl ether copolymer; styrol\\xad maleic acid copolymer; 2-ethyl-hexyl-acrylate maleic acid anhydride; crotonic acid-vinyl acetate copolymer; glutaminic acid/glutamic acid ester copolymer; carboxymethylethylcellulose glycerol monooctanoate; polyarginine; poly(ethylene); poly(propylene); poly(ethylene oxide); poly(ethylene terephthalate); poly(vinyl isobutyl ether); poly(vinyl chloride); and polyurethane. A combination of enteric materials may also be used. In one embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves at pH 5.5 and higher, to provide fast dissolution in the upper bowel. For example, the enteric material can be selected from a copolymer of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate, and a copolymer of methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate. For example, an enteric polymer is poly(methacrylic acid co-ethyl acrylate)!:1 (Eudragit™ L 30 D-55 and Eudragit™ L 100-55).\\n\\n[0158] Other suitable examples of enteric coating coatings include beeswax and glyceryl monostearate; beeswax, shellac and cellulose; and cetyl alcohol, mastic and shellac, and\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshellac and stearic acid; polyvinyl acetate and ethyl cellulose; and neutral copolymer of polymethacrylic acid esters (Eudragit™ L 30D); copolymers of methacrylic acid and methacrylic acid methylester, or a neutral copolymer ofpolymethacrylic acid esters containing metallic stearates. Such coatings comprise mixtures of fats and fatty acids, shellac and shellac derivatives and the cellulose acid phthalates, e.g., those having a free carboxyl content.\\n\\n[0159] One or more plasticizers can be added to enteric polymers to increase their pliability and reduce brittleness, as known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include, for example, butyl citrates, triethyl citrate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, polyethylene glycols (PEGs, such as PEG 6000), acetyl triethyl citrate, and triacetin. In one embodiment, the plasticizer is triethyl citrate. While some enteric materials are flexible and do not require plasticizers, more brittle polymers (e.g., Eudragit™ LIS types, Eudragit™ RL/RS, and Eudragit™ FS 30 D) benefit from plasticizers, for example ranging from between 5 wt.% and 30 wt.% based on the dry polymer mass, between about 8 wt.% and about 12 wt.% triethyl citrate with poly(methacrylic acid co-ethyl acrylate) 1:1.\\n\\n[0160] In certain embodiments, the enteric coatings comprise one or more anti-tacking agents (antiadherents) to reduce the tackiness of the film and prevent agglomeration, as it is known in the art. Suitable anti-tacking agents include, but are not limited to talc, glyceryl monostearate, fumed silica (e.g., Aerosil™ 200), precipitated silica (e.g., Sipemat™ PQ), and magnesium stearate. Anti-tacking agents can be used in any suitable quantity, for example ranging between about 10 wt.% and 100 wt.% based on dry polymer mass, between about 10 wt.% and about 50 wt.%, between about 10 wt.% and about 30 wt.%, or between about 15 wt.% and about 30 wt.%. For example, in one embodiment in ranges between 15 wt.% and about 30 wt.% based on dry polymer mass.\\n\\n[0161] One or more surfactants can also be added to an enteric coating mixture to increase substrate wettability and/or stabilize suspensions, as it is known in the art. Surfactants include Polysorbate 80, sorbitan monooleate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, and other surfactants described herein.\\n\\n[0162] The enteric coating can be formed by any suitable process. Coating processes include pan coating, fluid bed coating, and dry coating (e.g., heat dry coating and electrostatic dry coating), for example. Pan coating and fluid bed coating using solvent are well established processes. In liquid coating, the enteric material and optional excipients (e.g. pigments, plasticizers, anti-tacking agents) are mixed in an organic solvent or water to form a solution\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor dispersion. The coating solution or dispersion is sprayed into solid dosage forms in a pan coater or a fluid bed dryer and dried by hot air. For example, in a Wurster fluid bed coating process, the coating fluid is sprayed from the bottom of the fluid bed apparatus. Alternatively, the coating fluid is applied by top spraying. In certain embodiments, a tangential spray is applied.\\n\\n[0163] The amount of enteric material applied is sufficient to achieve desired acid resistance and release characteristics. For example, in one embodiment the amount of enteric coating meets USP <711> requirements (USP 36-NF 31) for delayed-release dosage forms, thereby not releasing 10.0 wt.% of drug after 2 hours in 0.1 N HCl. In certain embodiments, the formulation releases at least 80% of the active in 20 minutes in pH 6.8 buffer solution, e.g. using a dissolution method of USP 36-NF 31 section <711>.\\n\\n[0164] In one embodiment, the enteric coating is present in an amount in a range between about 10% and 40%, or between 25% and about 35% as measured by the weight gain compared to the uncoated particle cores, or ranging between about 25% and about 31% weight gain, between about 27% and about 31% weight gain, or between about 28.5% and about 31% weight gain, based on the weight of the uncoated particle cores.\\n\\n[0165] The formulation can include a capsule shell in which the beads are disposed. Soft and hard capsule shells are known. In one embodiment, the capsule shell is a hard-capsule shell,\\n\\ne.g. a gelatin capsule shell or a vegetable-based hard capsule shell. In certain embodiments, the capsule shell comprises one or more enteric coatings described herein. During accelerated storage, gelatin capsules may collapse. Thus, in certain embodiments, the formulation can include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsule shell.\\n\\n[0166] Thus, for example, one embodiment combining various of the features described above includes a pharmaceutical dosage form comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads, the beads comprising a core comprising xanomeline tartrate, a filler (optionally microcrystalline cellulose), a binder (optionally hypromellose), and an enteric coating (optionally Eudragit™ L 30 D-55) surrounding the core, wherein the plurality of beads has a distribution of particle sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, wherein the enteric coating ranges between about 20% and about 40% based on the weight of the bead cores, and wherein the beads are disposed in a capsule shell.\\n\\nBead size and shape\\n\\n[0167] The plurality of beads has a distribution of particle sizes. The plurality of beads has bead shapes. The plurality of beads has a distribution of coating thicknesses when present.\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0168] Beads having a distribution of particle sizes were shown to exhibit advantageous pharmacokinetics. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is contemplated that the pharmacokinetics are influenced by the plurality of beads having a distribution of core sizes. [0169] In one embodiment, the particle sizes of the beads range between about 0.4 mm and about 1.2 mm, such as between about 0.4 mm and about 0.5 mm, between about 0.5 mm and about 0.6 mm, between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm, between about 0.7 mm and about\\n\\n0.8 mm, between about 0.8 mm and about 0.9 mm, between about 0.9 mm and about 1.0 mm, between about 1.0 mm and about 1.1 mm, or between about 1.1 mm and about 1.2 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the xanomeline beads is between about 0.425 mm and about\\n\\n1.18 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the xanomeline beads is between about 0.6 mm and about 0.85 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the trospium beads is between about\\n\\n0.425 mm and about 1.18 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the trospium beads is between about 0.6 mm and about 0.85 mm.\\n\\n[0170] The beads or bead mixtures may be used, for example, in suspensions, filled into capsules, compressed into tablets, or filled into sachets. One or more types of modified release beads can be mixed together and encapsulated, or used as a sprinkle on the subject\\'s food. In certain embodiments, the oral solid dosage form may be any of these forms. In certain embodiments, the dosage form is a capsule.\\n\\n[0171] As the particle size of the beads becomes too small, the variability in content of the active increases. As the particle size becomes too large, the beads are too large for drug products labeled to be administered via sprinkling (e.g., on applesauce or other soft foods, such as jellies) and swallowed without chewing, or administered via an enteral feeding tube. Also, as the particle size increases, the larger particles get coated more than the smaller particles, resulting in lower relative assay compared to smaller particles. To compensate, relatively more beads are needed to meet the label strength per capsule. Filling a capsule shell with sufficient large particles to meet the label strength per capsule becomes difficult or impossible (e.g. to fill a size O capsule to a 75-mg strength of xanomeline free base).\\n\\n[0172] In one embodiment, the beads are formulated into capsules, e.g., with an encapsulation machine. Various capsule sizes may accommodate the strength and fill weight of the target formulations. Capsule size ranges from 00 to 5 for fill weights ranging between about 15 mg and about 630 mg.\\n\\n[0173] The beads can be sorted (e.g., via sieving) to a desired particle size. In certain embodiments, the particle size range is any particle size range or combination thereof\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndescribed above regarding the cores. In one embodiment, the particle size range is the same as the particle size range of the uncoated cores. For example, the beads can be sieved such that 5% or less of the bead cores by weight are retained on a #12 mesh (1.68 mm) screen and 10% or less by weight pass through a #20 mesh (0.84 mm) screen.\\n\\nMethod of Making\\n\\n[0174] Provided is a method for preparing an oral pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing beads comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads comprising xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a plurality oftrospium beads comprising a salt of trospium, such as trospium chloride. In certain embodiments, the method further comprises formulating the admixed beads into capsules.\\n\\n[0175] Also disclosed herein are a method for preparing the dosage form, comprising coating a core comprising xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an excipient with an enteric polymer to form the enteric coating, and coating a core comprising trospium chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an excipient with an enteric polymer to form the enteric coating. Optionally, the core can be formed by a wet granulation method. Optionally, drug beads are sorted (e.g., via sieving) to a desired particle size range before enteric coating, and optionally again following enteric coating.\\n\\n[0176] The drug beads may be made by different processes including, but not limited to, spheronizing an extruded wet mass and coating of inert core spheres in a fluidized bed. In certain embodiments, the beads are prepared by extrusion and spheronization.\\n\\n[0177] The beads are formulated to flow freely and to be compatible with modem encapsulation equipment. In some embodiments, the beads are blended together to form a uniform mixture that can be filled into capsules in a single stage. In other embodiments, the beads are filled separately into capsules using a two-stage capsule filler.\\n\\n[0178] The cores comprising xanomeline or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be formed by any suitable process. In one embodiment, the core is formed by granulating a mixture ofxanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient and milling to a desired particle size range. In another embodiment, the core can be formed by extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient.\\n\\n[0179] The cores comprising trospium chloride or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be formed by any suitable process. In one embodiment, the core is formed by granulating a mixture oftrospium chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand milling to a desired particle size range. In another embodiment, the core can be formed by extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of trospiurn chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient.\\n\\n[0180] Granulating processes can include fluid bed granulation, wet granulation, hot melt granulation, and spray congealing, for example. Other processes include slugging and roller compaction. The mixtures to be granulated can first be dry-blended. The dry-blended dry ingredients can be mixed with water before extrusion.\\n\\n[0181] Extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and trospiurn chloride with an excipient provides desirable cores with a distribution of particle sizes as described herein and one or more other desirable properties. In certain embodiments, short processing times can lead to a more stable product. For example, reducing spheronization reduces the friction and related heat. Reducing the time that the product is exposed to air (either when moist and/or before packaging) also diminishes oxidation. On the other hand, rapid processing by extrusion and spheronization can lead to a poor-quality product, for example in having a large fraction of the bead cores falling outside a desired particle size range. The moisture absorbed by spheronization aids (which happens over time) influences the spheronization characteristics of the beads.\\n\\n[0182] Accordingly, in one embodiment the moisture content of the granulation mixture, before drying, ranging between about 20 wt.% and about 40 wt.%, such as between 25 wt.% and about 35 wt.%, between about 28 wt.% and about 32 wt.%, at least about 28 wt.%, at least about 28.5, between about 20 wt.% and about 40 wt.%, between about 25 wt.% and about 35 wt.%, between about 27 wt.% and about 31 wt.%, or between about 28.5 wt.% and about 31 wt.%.\\n\\n[0183] In certain embodiments, the wet mass can be held before extrusion, for example to allow the spheronization aid to swell with granulating fluid. The hold time can be at least 15 minutes, such as at least 30 minutes, at least 45 minutes, or at least 60 minutes. In certain embodiments, the hold time ranging between about 15 minutes and about 120 minutes, such as between about 30 minutes and 100 minutes, or between 60 minutes and 90 minutes.\\n\\n[0184] As described above relating to cores, the method can include a step of sorting (e.g., by sieving) the cores before optional coating, to retain particles in a predetermined size range, for example sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.8 mm, such as between about\\n\\n0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, between about 0.8 mm and about 1.7 mm, or any range described herein.\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[0185] As described above relating to beads, the method can include a step of sorting (e.g., by sieving) the beads after optional coating, to retain particles in a size range, for example sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.8 mm, such as between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, or between about 0.8 mm and about 1.7 mm, or any range described herein. [0186] In an extrusion and spheronization process, the following optional features can be employed, individually or in one or more combinations thereof. Water can be a granulation agent. Microcrystalline cellulose can be in the cores as a spheronization aid. Hypromellose can be included in the cores as a binder. The extrusion screen size can be 1.0 mm The friction plate of the spheronizer can be cross-hatched. The friction plate of the spheronizer can be cross-hatched with a square pitch of at least about 3 mm, or greater than about 3 mm, or at least about 4 mm, or greater than about 4 mm, or ranging between about 3 mm and about 7 mm, or about 5 mm The spheronization time can be less than about 5 minutes, or less than about 4 minutes, or less than about 3 minutes, or less than about 2 minutes, or up to 1 minute. The spheronized particles can include non-spherical particles (i.e. irregular shapes), for example a substantial fraction thereof, such as at least about 20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt.%, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at least about 60 wt.%, or at least about 70 wt.% thereof.\\n\\n[0187] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored with a desiccant, for example, pharmaceutical grades of silica gel, crystalline sodium, potassium or calcium aluminosilicate, colloidal silica, anhydrous calcium sulphate and the like.\\n\\n[0188] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored with an oxygen absorber.\\n\\n[0189] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored under a dry inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, argon, neon, xenon, krypton or a mixture thereof.\\n\\n[0190] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored under a reduced pressure in comparison with the external ambient air.\\n\\n[0191] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored at a reduced temperature, e.g., at refrigerated temperatures (e.g., 2 °C to 8 °C). In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored in such a manner have fewer impurities, such as Impurity A, than when stored at 25 °C.\\n\\n[0192] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored by a manufacturer, a distributor, a pharmacy, or a hospital at a temperature of between about 2 °C and about 8 °C prior to dispensing the oral pharmaceutical composition to the subject.

Also provided is a method for treating a disorder ameliorated by activating muscarinic receptors in a subject in need thereof: comprising administering to the subject in need thereof any oral phannaceutical composition described herein.\\n\\n[0202] While activators of Ml and M4 muscarinic receptors have been suggested to be efficacious treatments for schizophrenia, the activation of muscarinic receptors located outside the brain has resulted in side effects w-hich barred xanomeline from the clinic. For instance, in both Phase I and subsequent trials, the muscarinic agonist xanomeline had unacceptable GI and other side effects linked to binding of muscarinic receptors in the body\\'s periphery. By combining a xanorneline with trnspium chloride, desired therapeutic effect is achieved while diminishing or eliminating the side effects associated with activating muscarinic receptors located outside the brain.\\n\\n[0203] TI1e tolerability ofxanomeline, a muscarinic activator, is increased by co\\xad administering trospium chloride, a muscarinic antagonist. The most common adverse events observed with administering xanomeline are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, and excessive salivation (so-called cholinergic adverse events). The disclosed compositions\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreduced the incidence of these adverse events in humans, evincing increased xanomeline tolerability.\\n\\n[0204] In one embodiment, xanomeline is combined with trospium chloride to treat muscarinic disorders, ameliorating symptoms in response to muscarinic activation by xanomeline in living tissues found outside the brain. In an embodiment, such diseases or disorders include schizophrenia and diseases related to schizophrenia, cognitive disorders in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s, and pain such as nociceptive pain or neuropathic pain. The combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride is a safer method for treating those diseases shown to be responsive to activation of muscarinic receptors.\\n\\n[0205] In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat mood disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat movement disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat cognitive disorders, including enhancing cognitive function not associated with a specific pathology. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat attention disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat pain. Outside disease treatment, enhancing attention accelerates learning and decreases fatigue due to both lack of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, such as jet lag. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat addictive disorders.\\n\\n[0206] In one embodiment, xanomeline combined with trospium chloride treat an animal. In a further embodiment, the animal is a mammal. In an embodiment, the mammal is a human being.\\n\\n[0207] In one embodiment, trospium chloride decreases the side effects associated with xanomeline. Such side effects include, but are not limited to, GI side effects, cardiac side effects, excessive sweating, and excessive salivation. Use of trospium with xanomeline allows the xanomeline to be used clinically when the xanomeline would not otherwise be used clinically due to its side effects. In another embodiment, use of trospium chloride with the xanomeline allows for the xanomeline to achieve a higher maximum tolerated dose than xanomeline would otherwise achieve.\\n\\n[0208] Various time and resource intensive methods demonstrated the efficacy of the combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride. For example, animal models demonstrate the efficacy of new therapeutics for schizophrenia, including both pharmacological models (e.g., ketamine model) and genetic models (e.g., DISCl mouse). Likewise, animal models including rodents, dogs and non-human primates demonstrate the side effect profile of\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npharmacological agents. Animal models are an experimental proxy for humans but may\\n\\nsuffer from deficiencies in the physiological differences between human and animals and thus may have limited predictive power for human experiments, particularly for central nervous system disorders. Alternatively, the disclosed combination can be tried in controlled clinical trials of people. Standard measures based on patient self-report can be used by those skilled in the art to assess various side effects such as GI discomfort. As another example, objective physiological measures (e.g., EKGs) may be used by those skilled in the art. A set of standard measures has also been developed to assess schizophrenia symptoms including the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Typically, clinical trials are double blinded, where one group of patients receives an inactive placebo and the other group the active intervention. [0209] Before administering the claimed combinations, patients may have a lead-in period from one to fourteen days, during which lead-in period trospium chloride is given alone. In one embodiment, the trospium chloride is administered for one or more dose periods before administering xanomeline to accumulate trospium chloride in the body, or for the trospium chloride to reach or approach steady-state exposure levels. This accumulation, or higher exposure levels of the trospium chloride, increases the blockade of muscarinic receptors outside of the brain and reduces adverse events when xanomeline is administered. In another embodiment, the trospium chloride is administered for one or more days before xanomeline. [0210] In one embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 6 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 5 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 4 times during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 3 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient twice during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient once during a 24-hour period.\\n\\n[0211] In one embodiment, an extended release formulation of trospium chloride is used in combination with xanomeline. In another embodiment, trospium chloride extended release is administered to a patient from one time to five times during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, trospium chloride extended release is administered from one to three times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, from five milligrams to 400 milligrams of trospium chloride extended release is used during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, from\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20 milligrams to 200 milligrams of trospium chloride extended release is used during a 24- hour period.\\n\\n[0212] In one embodiment, 225 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 100 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 30 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 200 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 200 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 250 mg xanomeline and 60 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 250 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 300 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 300 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. [0213] Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by small increments until a balance between therapeutic effect and side effects is attained. While the subject is being treated, the health of the patient may be monitored by measuring one or more of the relevant indices at predetermined times during the treatment period.

The dry blending step is optional, as blend uniformity is driven by subsequent wet granulation. Beads were screened by hand through a 40 mesh (425 µm) sieve.\\n\\n[0217] Wetting was carried out in the Hobart. The water was added using a Cole-Parmer peristaltic pump. Water addition rate (amount of water /dose time) is a process variable. [0218] The wet mass was extruded through a perforated screen (dome configuration) single screw extruder using a LCI Multi Granulator MG-55 at 30 rpm (shaft speed). The wet mass was extruded directly after wetting. Hold time, shaft speed, and extrusion rate (load) were process variables.\\n\\n[0219] The extrudates were placed into a LCI Marumerizer (spheronizer) QJ-230T equipped with 2.0 mm friction plate. The extrudates were spheronized at different plate speed for a total of not more than 4 minutes. Spheronization speed and time are process variables. [0220] The beads were dried using an Aeromatic™ Strea-1 fluid bed at inlet temperature of 60 °C until a water content of not more than 3% was obtained. Because beads melted after a few minutes at 60 °C, the beads were dried at 30 °C.\\n\\n\\n\\nN N\\n\\n\\t0\\t[0221] Water content was evaluated gravimetrically by loss-on-drying (LOD) using a Mettler\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n00\\n\\n-.::j\\'\" N N\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\nToledo halogen Moisture Analyser, type HR83.

Samples were placed on metallic stubs using double-sided carbon conductive tape. The images were obtained with accelerating voltages of 20 kV under low vacuum (60 Pa) and magnification 30x.\\n\\n[0226] Bulk and tapped density were determined in duplicate using the USP <616> method using a tapped density tester (N 1000, Copley Scientific). The bulk density was measured from the volume of a known mass of powder sample in a graduated cylinder. The tapped density was measured by mechanically tapping the measuring cylinder until the volume changed no further.\\n\\n[0227] The powder flow properties were evaluated using the Carr\\'s Compressibility Index and Hausner ratio, both derived using the measured values for bulk and tapped density Carr\\'s Compressibility Index (CI) was calculated using bulk and tapped density data when fitted into the equation: Compressibility Index= (Tapped density - Bulk density)/ Tapped density x 100%. Hausner Ratio (H) was calculated as the ratio of tapped to bulk density. Capsules were analyzed for appearance, assay, related substances, water content, and dissolution. FIG. 1 shows the stability schedule and protocol for xanomeline/trospium capsules.\\n\\n[0228] The beads were further sized between 0.6 mm and 0.85 mm. Some beads exhibited similar morphological properties. Modifications in some other beads decreased the density of beads and lead to rough surfaces and loss of sphericity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images ofxanomeline tartrate 66% beads (FIG. 2) trospium chloride 17.7% beads (FIG. 3) at 30x magnification showed that the beads are sized between 0.6 mm and 0.85 mm These beads were used in xanomeline/trospium capsules. Particle size distribution (PSD) of beads was determined by mechanical sieving.

Based on available data, a shelf-life of 15 months at 25°C/60(%RH is proposed.\\n\\n[0232] The dissolution results show that the two compounds release quickly, ·which may increase their bioavailability, and that they also release at comparable rates despite substantial differences in compositions between the two head formulations. Both xanomeline a.nd trospium chloride have low bioavailahilities, and rapid relemse can increase bioavailability by overwhelming saturable processes that limit absorption into the general circulation.\\n\\n10233] An unknown xanomeline impurity \\\\Vith a relative retention time of about 1.09 was observed during stability studies of the combination drug products. The impurity was first observed during testing at the three-month time point for the 50 mg xanomeline/ l O mg trospium chloride drng product and at the initial time point for the other three combination products, both of which occurred at the same time. The impurity peak increased both with time and with increasing storage ternperature. The irnpurity had not been observed before the present studies.\\n\\n10234] Preliminary studies suggest that the RRT 1.09 impurity is 3-[(4-hexyloxy)-1,2,5- thiadiazol-3-yl]-5-hydroxyl-1-methy!pyridin-l-ium (C14l-hoN302S+, MW ,cc 294.1271 Da):\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'N OH\\n\\nV\\n\\nN&O\\n\\n\\n\\n10235] The RRT 1.09 impurity is ahydroxylated version of Compound V (C14H20N3OS\\', MW\\'\" 278.1322 Da), which is the penultimate intermediate in the synthesis of xanomeline V\\\\ th negative mutagenic potential:\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nV\\'N\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tNb\\tO\\n\\n.-3-r:.f\\n\\n[0236] To reduce the presence of the impurity, the storage temperature for the drug product was lowered.

In this study, the co-administration of trospium chloride with xanomeline led to a statistically\\n\\n\\n\\n00\\n\\n-.::j\\'\"\\n\\nN N N N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\nsignificant (p = 0.016) 43% reduction in the incidence rate of cholinergic adverse events compared to xanomeline co-administered with placebo. In the xanomeline + placebo arm of the study, 63% of subjects reported at least one cholinergic adverse event, compared to only 34% of subjects reporting such an event in the xanomeline + trospium chloride arm of the study.\\n\\n[0240] Further, in the study, each kind of individual cholinergic adverse event also had a decreased incidence rate in subjects administered xanomeline + trospium chloride, compared to the incidence rate in subjects administered xanomeline +placebo.The decrease in incidence rate of sweating was statistically significant on its own, at 20.0% in the xanomeline\\n\\n+ trospium chloride arm, down from 48.5% in the xanomeline + placebo arm, which was a 59% reduction (p = 0.013).\\n\\n[0241] The overall cholinergic adverse event rate in the xanomeline + trospium chloride arm of the study was very similar to the 32% incidence rate reported during the two-day run-in period for subjects on placebo+ placebo. Although these two data points did not occur during different periods of the study, the fact that the cholinergic adverse event rate was comparable to that of placebo suggests that the 43% reduction in adverse events due to trospium chloride may have been close to the maximum reduction possible in this study.\\n\\n[0242] Table 19 shows the incidence and number of cholinergic adverse events in the evaluable population of the study was as follows, with all p-values based on a chi-squared test, except those marked with an*, which were based on a Fisher\\'s exact test.\\n\\nTable 19: Cholinergic adverse events\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXanomeline +\\n\\nplacebo (n = 34)\\n\\nXanomeline + Trospium\\n\\n(n = 35)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategory\\n\\n(n [%] [# of events])\\n\\n(n [%] [# of events])\\n\\nP-value for\\n\\ndifference\\n\\n%\\n\\nReduction\\n\\nAny\\n\\n21 (63.6%) 64\\n\\n12 (34.3%) 33\\n\\n0.0155\\n\\n46%\\n\\n\\n\\nN N 0\\n\\nN\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nr./)\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTEAEs\\n\\nNausea\\n\\n8 (24.2%) 11\\n\\n6(17.1%)8\\n\\n0.4693\\n\\n29%\\n\\nVomiting\\n\\n5 (15.2%) 5\\n\\n2 (5.7%) 2\\n\\n0.2522*\\n\\n62%\\n\\nDiarrhea\\n\\n7 (21.2%) 8\\n\\n2 (5.7%) 4\\n\\n0.0794*\\n\\n73%\\n\\nSweating\\n\\n16 (48.5%) 24\\n\\n7 (20.0%) 8\\n\\n0.0131\\n\\n59%\\n\\nSalivation\\n\\n12 (36.4%) 16\\n\\n9 (25.7%) 11\\n\\n0.342\\n\\n39%\\n\\n\\n\\n[0243] In addition to evaluating whether adding trospium chloride increased the tolerability of xanomeline, the study also provided data about the overall safety and tolerability of xanomeline + trospium chloride.

Subjects signed the informed consent and underwent Screening assessments on\\n\\nDays -21 to -1. Upon successfully completing all Screening assessments, subjects returned to the study clinic on Day O for baseline safety assessments and enrollment into the study and were randomized 3:1 in each cohort into one of two treatment arms: KarXT or placebo.\\n\\nSubjects were assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts (Cohort 1, 2, 3, or 4).\\n\\n[0246] Study drug was administered BID on Days 1 through 7. A combination dosage formulation of both xanomeline and trospium was used in all cohorts. All cohorts began with a 2-day lead-in of KarXT 50/20 BID (for subjects randomized to active treatment); after the 2-day lead-in period, the unblinded pharmacist dispensed the study drug to each subject per the subject\\'s randomization assignment for 5 days of specified cohort dosing, for a total of 7 days of treatment. Matching placebo was administered throughout the study to maintain the blind. A sentinel group was introduced to the study for Cohorts 2 to 4 and was monitored for safety and tolerability by the Data Safety Evaluation Group (DSEG), such that about 30% of the proposed cohort was treated and assessed for safety before the rest of the cohort was dosed. Subjects and study clinic staff were blinded to treatment. The Dose Selection Committee (DSC) was unblinded to decide dosing for subsequent treatment groups.\\n\\n[0247] Serial blood samples for the PK assessment of xanomeline and trospium were drawn on Days 1, 3, and 7. More blood was sampled at routine intervals for monitoring trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospium and clinical laboratory assessments. On Day 1, saliva volume was collected twice. A saliva volume was measured predose on Day 1 and then daily (afternoon) on Days 1 through 7 at about the same time of day to avoid diurnal variations. Other assessments included pupil size measurements and Bristol stool scale assessments. Subjects remained in the study clinic for the full duration of treatment (7 days). Following a safety assessment on Day 8, subjects were discharged from the study clinic, and asked to return about 14 days after administration of study drug for a final safety assessment.

Dosing of Cohort 2 was discontinued (DSEG decision based on observed tolerability concerns). The study proceeded to dosing of the Cohort 3 sentinel group (Group 3a) as the DSC determined that further dosing of Cohort 2 with KarXT 150/20 BID was unlikely to be tolerated well enough to warrant further developing this dose combination for a clinical population.\\n\\n\\tIn Cohort 3, the sentinel group (Group 3a) completed Days 3 through 7 of dosing\\n\\nof KarXT 150/40 BID (TDD of 300 mg xanomeline plus 80 mg trospium) or placebo.

The PK parameters listed below were calculated from the individual xanomeline and trospium concentration-time profiles by standard non-compartmental methods. Dose-normalized parameters were calculated for Crnax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values. During the study, additional blood samples for monitoring trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospium\\n\\nwere collected on Days 2, 4, 5, and 6 before the morning dose and before discharge on Day 8.

The TEAEs were defined as adverse events that happened for the first time after dosing of study drug, or existed before but worsened in severity or relationship to study drug after dosing. For noncholinergic adverse events, the first dose of any study drug (Day 1) was used, and for cholinergic adverse events, the first dose of xanomeline (Day 3) was used. Cholinergic adverse events had the additional specification that the start of the adverse event must have been within 24 hours (inclusive) of the last dose to be treatment-emergent. At each level of summation (total, system organ class term, preferred term), subjects who reported more than one adverse event were counted only once. During the study, a subject could have contributed to more than one preferred term.\\n\\nIn KAR-001, xanomeline dosing started on Day 3. Hence Day 3 was the first day of xanomeline dosing and Day 9 was the seventh day of xanomeline dosing.\\n\\n\\t\\tIn KAR-001, the xanomeline-alone treatment arm received two placebo capsules TID during the 2-day lead-in phase, then xanomeline 75 mg TID (TDD 225 mg) and placebo on Days 3 through 9.\\n\\n\\tIn KAR-001, the xanomeline + trospium arm received trospium 20 mg BID (TDD 40 mg) and placebo BID; and two placebo capsules QD during the 2-day lead-in phase; then xanomeline 75 mg TID and trospium 20 mg BID (TDD 40 mg) and placebo QD\\n\\non Days 3 through 9.\\n\\n[0289] Subject incidence of salivary hypersecretion, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea was higher in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 compared to the KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups.

Nausea occurred in 17.1% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 and 22.2% of subjects in each KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups.

The PK results suggest that neither xanomeline nor trospium meaningfully impacted the PK behavior of the other drug. The KAR-003 formulation provided enhanced xanomeline and trospium blood levels compared to KAR-001, where both compounds were dosed apart.\\n\\n[0292] No new safety signals were reported with the KarXT formulation.

The disease is characterized by a set of symptorns divided into positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thoughts, etc.), negative symptoms (e.g., social isolation, anhedonia, etc.), and cognitive symptoms (e.g., inability to process information, poor working memory, etc.). Patients who suffer from schizophrenia experience a major decline in quality oflife and are at increased risk for mortality due to many factors, such as an increased suicide rate. The cost of schizophrenia to society is high, as sufferers of schizophrenia are much more likely to be incarcerated, homeless or unemployed.[0004] Existing treatments for schizophrenia rely upon dopamine and serotonin receptors, as was the case \\'.vith the first antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, discovered in 1952. For more than 60 years, the same fundamental pharmacology has been the standard of care in schizophrenia. Current antipsychotics are only efficacious toward positive symptoms, leaving negative and co1:,111itive symptoms untreated. Alzheimer\\'s disease is another therapeutic area in which it has proven extremely difficult to develop ne\\\\v therapies, \\\\Vith a success rate of only 0.4% for molecules that enter clinical development and receive marketing approval. New treatments are desperately needed by patients in these areas, but development has been extremely difficult despite substantial efforts from scientists and drug developers around the world. [0005] Activating the muscarinic system through muscarinic agonists may treat several diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\\'s disease, Parkinson\\'s disease, depression, movement disorders, drug addiction. pain, and neurodegeneration, such as tauopathies or synucleinopathies. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors with five different receptor sub1-y pes (Ml-M5), each of which is found in the CNS with different tissue distributions. MI and M4 subtypes have been of interest as therapeutic targets for various diseases. For instance, the mood stabilizers lithium and valproic acid, used for treatingbipolar depression, may exert their effects via the muscarinic system particularly through theRECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91) - ISA/USN N 0N(1)r./)0M4 subtype receptor. Genetic evidence directly links the muscarinic system and alcohol addiction.[0006] In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenic patients using xanomeline, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist with preferential activity at the Ml and M4 subtype receptors, schizophrenia was alleviated. However, because xanomeline also bound to muscarinic receptors outside the brain, many serious side effects resulted, including GI side effects, cardiac side effects and hypersalivation. Dose-limited adverse events were problematic and led to very high discontinuation rates (including a 56% dropout rate in a 26- week study of Alzheimer\\'s disease) and eventually to discontinuation of xanomeline development. Despite the early promise, xanomeline development halted for more than 15 years. Many companies attempted and failed to develop muscarinic receptor agonists for CNS disorders which avoided these unacceptable side effects, but no such agonist has reached the market. Past development efforts focused on medicinal chemistry to develop molecules that would be more tolerable, typically by selecting for the Ml and M4 subtypes over the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes. However, Ml and/or M4 activation outside the brain may still cause muscarinic related intolerance. Very little progress has been made to mitigate adverse effects due to the activation of peripheral muscarinic receptors. [0007] There remains a need in the art for a pharmaceutical composition with increased tolerability for xanomeline, especially to treat cognitive and psychotic disorders.

[0080] All ranges set forth herein include all possible subsets of ranges and any combinations of such subset ranges. By default, ranges include the stated endpoints, unless stated otherwise, where a range of values is provided, each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range, is encompassed within the disclosure. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges, and are also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also contemplated to be part of the disclosure.[0081] The term \"wt.%\" is the weight percent based on the total weight, e.g. of the core, or enteric coating, or total bead, as described in context. Unless stated otherwise, the wt.% is intended to describe the weight percent based on dry weight (e.g., for a core following drying).[0082] The term \"controlled release\" is defined as a prolonged release pattern of one or more drugs, such that the drugs are released over a period. A controlled release formulation has release kinetics that result in measurable serum levels of the drug over a period longer than what would be possible following intravenous injection or following administration of an immediate release oral dosage form. Controlled release, slow release, sustained release, extended release, prolonged release, and delayed release have the same definitions herein. [0083] The term \"including\" means \"including but not limited to.\" \"Including\" and \"including but not limited to\" are used interchangeably.[0084] The term \"mammal\" is known in the art. Exemplary mammals include humans, primates, bovines, porcines, canines, felines, and rodents (e.g., mice and rats).[0085] The terms \"parenteral administration\" and \"administered parenterally\" are art\\xad recognized and refer to modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection. These modes include without limitation intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal,N N 0N(1)r./)0transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intra-articular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, and intrastemal injection and infusion.[0086] A \"patient,\" \"subject\" or \"host\" to be treated by the subject method mean either a human or non-human mammal.[0087] The term \"pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier\" is art-recognized and refers to a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting any subject composition or component thereof from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the subject composition and its components and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials that may serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as com starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer\\'s solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.[0088] The term \"pharmaceutically-acceptable salts\" is art-recognized and refers to salts prepared from relatively non-toxic acids or bases including inorganic acids and bases and organic acids and bases, including, for example, those contained in compositions of the present disclosure.

The broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with laws or regulations defining patentable subject matter is intended. In jurisdictions that do not forbid the patenting of methods practiced on the human body, the \"administering\" of compositions includes both methods practiced on the human body and the foregoing activities.[0091] The term \"therapeutic agent\" is art-recognized and refers to any chemical moiety that is a biologically, physiologically, or pharmacologically active substance acting locally or systemically in a subject. Examples of therapeutic agents, also referred to as \"drugs,\" are described in well-known literature references such as the Merck Index (14th edition), the Physicians\\' Desk Reference (64th edition), and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (12th edition). These therapeutic agents include without limitation medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of a disease or illness; substances that affect the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a physiological environment.[0092] The term \"psychotherapy\" refers to non-pharmacological therapies in which those skilled in the art use a variety of techniques involving verbal and other interactions with a patient to affect a positive therapeutic outcome. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, psychodynamic therapy, psychoanalytic therapy, group therapy, family counseling, art therapy, music therapy, vocational therapy, humanistic therapy, existential therapy, transpersonal therapy, client-centered therapy (also called person\\xad centered therapy), Gestalt therapy, biofeedback therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, reality therapy, response based therapy, Sandplay therapy, status dynamics therapy, hypnosis and validation therapy. Psychotherapy may involve combining two or more techniques. A therapist can select and adjust the techniques based on the needs of the individual patient and the patient\\'s response.[0093] The term \"muscarinic disorder\" refers to any disease or condition ameliorated by activating the muscarinic system Such diseases include ones in which direct activation of muscarinic receptors themselves or inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes has produced a therapeutic effect.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0094] The terms \"diseases related to schizophrenia\" and \"disorders related to schizophrenia\" include, but are not limited to, schizo-affective disorder, psychosis, delusional disorders, psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, psychosis associated with Parkinson\\'sdisease, psychotic depression, bipolar disorder, bipolar with psychosis, Huntington\\'s disease, Lewy Body dementia, or any other disease with psychotic features.[0095] The term \"movement disorders\" includes, but is not limited to, Gilles de la Tourette\\'s syndrome, Friederich\\'s ataxia, Huntington\\'s chorea, restless leg syndrome and other diseases or disorders whose symptoms include excessive movements, ticks and spasms.[0096] The term \"mood disorders\" includes major depressive disorder, dysthymia, recurrent brief depression, minor depression disorder, bipolar disorder, mania and anxiety.[0097] The term \"cognitive disorders\" refers to diseases or disorders marked by cognitive deficit (e.g., having abnormal working memory, problem solving abilities, etc.).

Diseases include, but are not limited to, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), Dubowitz Syndrome, FG Syndrome, Down\\'s Syndrome, growth delay due to insulin-like growth factor I (IGFl) deficiency, hepatic encephalopathy syndrome, and Strauss Syndrome.[0099] The term \"addictive disorders\" refers to diseases or conditions marked by addiction or substance dependence as defined by the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual V (DSM-5). Such disorders are characterized by physical dependence, withdrawal and tolerance to a substance. Such substances include but are not limited to alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, inhalants, nicotine, barbiturates, cocaine and cannabis. Addictive disorders also encompass behaviors that a patient does compulsively or continually despite clear negative consequences. For instance, ludomania (gambling addiction, or compulsive gambling) is recognized by those skilled in the art as being an addictive behavior that often has devastating consequences. In certain embodiments, the addictive behavior may be Internet Gaming Disorder (gaming addiction), as defined in the DSM-5.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0100] The term \"pain\" refers to physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury. Pain is a subjective experience and the perception of pain is performed parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Usually noxious (peripheral) stimuli are transmitted to the CNS beforehand, but pain is not always associated with nociception. A broad variety of clinical pain exists, derived from different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and needing different treatment approaches. Three major types of clinical pain have been characterized: acute pain, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain.[0101] Acute clinical pain may result, for example, from inflammation or soft tissue injury. This type of pain is adaptive and has the biologically relevant function of warning and enabling healing and repair of an already damaged body part to occur undisturbed. A protective function is achieved by making the injured or inflamed area and surrounding tissue hypersensitive to all stimuli so that contact with any external stimulus can be avoided. The neuronal mechanisms underlying this type of clinical pain are well understood and pharmacological control of acute clinical pain is available and effective, for example by means of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) up to opioids depending on type and extent of the sensation of pain.[0102] Chronic clinical pain appears as sustained sensory abnormalities resulting from an ongoing peripheral pathology such as cancer or chronic inflammation (e.g., arthritis) or it can be independent of such initiating triggers. Chronic pain independent of initiating triggers is maladaptive, offering no survival advantage, and very often no effective treatment is available.[0103] Neuropathic pain can be classified as peripheral or central. Peripheral neuropathic pain is caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves, whereas central neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the CNS or/and the spinal cord. Both peripheral and central neuropathic pain can occur without obvious initial nerve damage.[0104] The term \"activator\" means a molecule described as an agonist, partial agonist, co\\xad agonist, physiological agonist, potentiator, stimulator, allosteric potentiator, positive allosteric modulator, allosteric agonist, or a molecule that increases the activity or signaling of receptors directly or indirectly.[0105] The term \"inhibitor\" means a molecule described as an antagonist, partial antagonist, competitive antagonist, non-competitive antagonist, uncompetitive antagonist, silent antagonist, inverse agonist, reversible antagonist, physiological antagonist, irreversible antagonist, inhibitor, reversible inhibitor, irreversible inhibitor, negative allosteric modulator,N N 0N(1)r./)0allosteric antagonist, or a molecule that decreases the activity or signaling of receptors directly or indirectly.[0106] The term \"maximum tolerated dose\" means the highest dose of a drug or therapeutic that a patient can take without the patient experiencing intolerable side effects. The maximum tolerated dose is typically determined empirically in clinical trials.[0107] The term \"muscarinic receptors\" refers to G-protein linked receptors that bind the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. To date, five subtypes of muscarinic receptor have been identified. \"Ml\" means the subtype one muscarinic receptor. \"M2\" means the subtype two muscarinic receptor. \"M3\" means the subtype three muscarinic receptor. \"M4\" means the subtype four muscarinic receptor. \"MS\" means the subtype five muscarinic receptor.[0108] The term \"antipsychotic\" refers to a drug that diminishes psychosis, hallucinations or delusions. Antipsychotics include, but are not limited to haloperidol, droperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine, mesoridazine, periciazine, promazine, triflupromazine, levomepromazine, promethazine, pimozide, chlorprothixene, flupenthixol, thiothixene, zuclopenthixol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, amisulpride, asenapine, paliperidone, zotepine, aripiprazole, bifeprunox, and tetrabenazine.[0109] The term \"anxiolytics\" refers to drugs that reduce anxiety, fear, panic or related feelings. Such drugs include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam), buspirone, barbiturates (e.g., amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbitol), and hydroxyzine.[0110] The term \"anti-depressants\" refers to drugs that alleviate depression and related conditions (e.g., dysthymia). Such drugs include, but are not limited to, selective serotonin\\xad reuptake inhibitors (SSRls, e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRls, e.g., desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipram, venlafaxine), mianserin, mirtazapin, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., atomoxetine, mazindol, reboxetine, viloxazine), bupropion, tianeptine, agomelatine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). [0111] The terms \"sedatives\" or \"tranquilizers\" refer to drugs that induce somnolence, promote a feeling of being tired or desire to sleep, or promote a state of unconsciousness.N N 0N(1)r./)0Such drugs include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines, barbiturates (e.g., amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbitol), eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone.Pharmaceutical Compositions[0112] Earlier development of xanomeline, a muscarinic receptor agonist, as a monotherapy was halted due to peripheral cholinergic side effects. The current disclosure provides a dosage form with dissolution kinetics having a more effective therapeutic effect for both active ingredients, enhanced pharmacokinetics for trospium chloride, and greater dosing compliance. The current disclosure also provides dosage forms with different strengths and/or different ratios of the two actives.[0113] Provided herein is an oral pharmaceutical composition, comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads comprising xanomeline or a salt thereof; and a plurality of trospium beads comprising a salt of trospium. In certain embodiments, the plurality of xanomeline beads have a core comprising xanomeline or a salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the plurality of trospium beads have a core comprising a trospium salt.[0114] In certain embodiments, a capsule shell comprising hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) containing separate populations of drug beads containing xanomeline tartrate or trospium chloride wherein the drug beads are of comparable size and release the actives rapidly and at substantially similar rates. Following dissolution of the capsule shell in the stomach, the drug beads may dissolve in the stomach and/or pass through the pyloric valve into the duodenum intact or partially intact, but the ratio of the two drugs, both in dissolved form and in undissolved form remains relatively constant in the gastrointestinal tract until the drugs are absorbed.[0115] The formulation for each drug bead allows substantially similar performance from two actives at different dose ranges, where the actives are released into the blood serum at substantially similar rates and/or achieve a substantially similar Tmax. In certain embodiments, a capsule containing 50 mg xanomeline as the tartrate salt and 10 mg trospium chloride.Because 50 mg xanomeline as free base corresponds to about 76 mg xanomeline tartrate, the ratio of the active ingredients in such a formulation is about 7.6 to 1.[0116] A discrepancy in the number of drug beads in the capsule increases the probability that the ratio of drug beads would not remain substantially constant after the beads are released and disperse. Thus, in certain embodiments, the trospium beads are formulated with a lower drug load such that effective doses of trospium and of xanomeline are contained in roughly equivalent numbers of beads. In certain embodiments, despite the differences in drugN N 0N(1)r./)0loads, the trospium and xanomeline beads release at roughly similar rates. For example, if dissolution of the capsules is assessed using a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution apparatus, the percentage of xanomeline dissolved is substantially equivalent to the percentage of dissolved trospium chloride, such as at 10 min, 20 min, or 30 min.[0117] The medicament may also include one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable salts. The medicament may include one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers. The medicament may be administered orally. The medicament may be delivered orally using tablets, troches, liquids, emulsions, suspensions, drops, capsules, caplets or gel caps and other methods of oral administration known to one skilled in the art.[0118] The medicament may be in a dosage form that immediately releases the drug. In an alternative embodiment, the medicament may have a controlled release dosage form[0119] The medicament may be in dosage forms that use other methods of controlled release formulation known to one in the art.[0120] In another embodiment, the medicament is combined with one or more therapies, including psychotherapy and drugs. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited, to antipsychotics, anxiolytics, anti-depressants, sedatives, tranquilizers, analgesics and other pharmacological interventions known to one skilled in the art. A therapeutic agent may fall under the category of more than one drug. For instance, benzodiazepines can be considered anxiolytics, sedatives and tranquilizers.Bead/ Core Excipients[0121] The bead and/or core can comprise one or more excipients. In one embodiment, the excipients include one or more fillers, binders, and surfactants. Other optional ingredients include, but are not limited to, glidants, lubricants, disintegrants, swelling agents, and antioxidants. The xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the salt of trospium may be in separate matrices within the same medicament.[0122] The amount ofxanomeline free base in the core can be at least 10 wt.% or at least 15 wt.%, or at least 20 wt.%, or at least 25 wt.%, or at least 30 wt.%. For example, the amount of xanomeline tartrate can be at least 50 wt.%, or at least 55 wt.%, or at least 60 wt.%, or at least 65 wt.%, or at least 70 wt.%, or at least 75 wt.%, or at least 80 wt.%, or at least 85 wt.% of the core, for example in a range of about 60 wt.% to about 90 wt.% or about 65 wt.% to about 85 wt.%. It is understood that all ranges including these values as endpoints is contemplated, for example, at least between about 15 wt.% and about 90 wt.%, between about 20 wt.% and about 85 wt.%, between about 30 wt.% and about 85 wt.%, or between about 50 wt.% andN N 0N(1)r./)0about 90 wt.%.

In certain embodiments, the beads might be coated with a pH-sensitive coating so that they do not dissolve in the low pH of the stomach. A nonfunctional coating might be used to maintain chemical separation between the beads or for cosmetic reasons.[0147] In a further embodiment, the controlled release formulation comprises a semi\\xad permeable coating. The xanomeline and trospium chloride may be in different coatings in the same formulation. In another embodiment, the xanomeline and trospium chloride can be in different coatings in different formulations or dosing vehicles. In a further embodiment, the semi-permeable coating comprises a polymer. In a further embodiment, the controlled release formulation comprises a matrix that suspends the xanomeline and trospium chloride.[0148] In certain embodiments, the distribution of coating thicknesses can be stated in weight gain of coating material based on the total weight of the coated beads. Thus, in one embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 2% based on the total weight of the coated beads. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 3%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 4%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 5%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 6%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 7%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 8%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 9%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 10%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 11%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 12%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 13%. In another embodiment, the distribution of coating thicknesses is at least 14%.[0149] For example, the difference in coating thickness from bead to bead can be in a range of+/- 1-7% based on the total weight of the coated beads. The distribution of coating thicknesses can between about 2% and about 14% based on the weight of the coated beads, such as between about 3% and about 13%, between about 4% and about 12%, between about 5% and about 11%, between about 6% to about 10%, between about 7% and 9%, betweenN N 0N(1)r./)0about 3% and 14%, between about 4% and 14%, between about 4% and 13%, or between 4%and about 12%.[0150] In one embodiment, the absorption (area under the curve, AUC) of the dosage form when dosed orally is advantageously increased, compared to other dosage forms of xanomeline or trospium chloride. Without intending to be bound by any theory, the increase in absorption is influenced by the dosage form exhibiting a pseudo-extended release profile. The pseudo-extended release profile is influenced by one or more factors, including a distribution of coating thicknesses when present, a distribution of bead particle sizes, and the beads having irregular bead shapes. For example, in an embodiment wherein the beads have a distribution of coating thicknesses, for beads with a relatively thin coating, the coating completely dissolves at the trigger pH relatively quickly to release the xanomeline and/or trospium chloride compositions, whereas for beads having a relatively thick coating the coating takes somewhat longer to completely dissolve and release the xanomeline and/or trospium chloride compositions. In an embodiment where the beads have a distribution of particle sizes and/or irregular bead shapes, the gut transit time of the beads could be varied due to bead size and/or shape, such that the transit time until reaching the coating dissolution pH is varied, thus contributing to a pseudo-extended release profile. In another embodiment, the dosage form exhibits substantially equivalent (e.g., bioequivalent) Crnax and/or AUC characteristics when administered orally inside a capsule shell or without a capsule shell. [0151] In certain embodiments, the dosage form provides a progressive and predictable absorption curve. In one embodiment, the Tmax of the dosage form when dosed orally is more stable on a dose-to-dose basis, because the beads are individually coated. A predictable, consistent Tmax is advantageous for accomplishing a more consistent, sustained therapeutic effect. For example, process-related variations in coating thickness or other influences on coating dissolution affect only a fraction of the xanomeline and trospium chloride in the dosage form and tend to lead to the pseudo-extended release behavior. In contrast, coated capsules comprising xanomeline and trospium chloride microspheres exhibits significant variability in absorption time from capsule to capsule.[0152] In certain embodiments, the oral pharmaceutical composition comprises xanomeline and/or a salt thereof and trospium chloride for treating a muscarinic disorder in a patient in need thereof, which when administered to the patient in need thereof, the composition is sufficient to provide an in-vivo plasma profile comprising a median Tmax for xanomeline of 2 hours and a median Tmax for trospium of 1 hour. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasmaN N 0N(1)r./)0profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized Crnax of between 48.5 and 121.3 pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized Crnax of trospium of between 156 and 375 pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized AUCo-12 ofxanomeline of between 263 and 577 hr·pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean dose-normalized AUCo-12 of trospium of between 881 and 2024 hr·pg/mL/mg. In certain embodiments, the in-vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean Crnax of trospium at 7850 ± 3360 pg/mL. In certain embodiments, the in\\xad vivo plasma profile further comprises a mean AUCo-12 of 41900 ± 15500 hr·pg/mL.[0153] In another embodiment, the dosage form exhibits advantageous storage stability, e.g. as measured by the amount of xanomeline present following storage and/or by the total amount of related substances. The storage stability can be assessed following storage at typical ambient conditions (e.g. 25 °C and 60% relative humidity) or at accelerated stability conditions involving increased temperature and/or humidity.[0154] The dosage form and methods are contemplated to include embodiments of any combination of one or more of the additional optional elements, features, and steps further described below (including those shown in the figures and Examples), unless stated otherwise. Reference to a bead and properties thereof apply equally to a collection of beads (e.g., a plurality of such beads). Likewise, reference to a core and properties thereof apply equally to a collection of cores (e.g., a plurality of such cores).[0155] The enteric (gastro-resistant) coating material, e.g. polymer, can be one that will dissolve in intestinal juices at a pH level higher than that of the stomach, e.g. a pH of greater than 4.5, such as within the small intestine, and therefore permit release of the active substance in the regions of the small intestine and substantially not in the upper portion of the GI tract. In one embodiment, the enteric material begins to dissolve in an aqueous solution at pH between about 4.5 and about 5.5. In another embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves in an aqueous solution at pH between of about 5. In another embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves in an aqueous solution at pH between of about 5.5.[0156] For example, pH-sensitive materials do not significantly dissolve until the dosage form has emptied from the stomach. The pH of the small intestine gradually increases from about 4.5 to about 6.5 in the duodenal bulb to about 7.2 in the distal portions of the small intestine (ileum). To provide predictable dissolution corresponding to the small intestine transit time of about 3 hours (e.g., 2-3 hours) and permit reproducible release therein, theN N 0N(1)r./)0coating should begin to dissolve within the pH range of the duodenum, and continue to dissolve at the pH range within the small intestine. Therefore, the amount (thickness) of enteric coating should be sufficient to be substantially dissolved during the about three-hour transit time within the small intestine (e.g., the proximal and mid-small intestine).[0157] Suitable enteric (gastro-resistant) materials include, but are not limited to, cross\\xad linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone; non-crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone; hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate succinate; cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate; starch acetate phthalate; polyvinyl acetate phthalate; carboxymethyl cellulose; methyl cellulose phthalate; methyl cellulose succinate; methyl cellulose phthalate succinate; methyl cellulose phthalic acid half ester; ethyl cellulose succinate; carboxymethylamide; potassium methacrylate divinylbenzene copolymer; polyvinyl alcohols; polyoxyethylene glycols; polyethylene glycol; sodium alginate; galactomannan; carboxypolymethylene; sodium carboxymethyl starch; copolymers of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid with a monomer selected from the following: methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, decyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, phenyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, or octadecyl acrylate, e.g. Eudragit™ -Land -S series, including L 100-55, L 30 D-55, L 100, S 100, L 12.5, and S 12.5, available from Evonik Industries; polyvinyl acetate; fats; oils; waxes; fatty alcohols; shellac; zein; gluten; ethylacrylate-maleic acid anhydride copolymer; maleic acid anhydride-vinyl methyl ether copolymer; styrol\\xad maleic acid copolymer; 2-ethyl-hexyl-acrylate maleic acid anhydride; crotonic acid-vinyl acetate copolymer; glutaminic acid/glutamic acid ester copolymer; carboxymethylethylcellulose glycerol monooctanoate; polyarginine; poly(ethylene); poly(propylene); poly(ethylene oxide); poly(ethylene terephthalate); poly(vinyl isobutyl ether); poly(vinyl chloride); and polyurethane. A combination of enteric materials may also be used. In one embodiment, the enteric material rapidly dissolves at pH 5.5 and higher, to provide fast dissolution in the upper bowel. For example, the enteric material can be selected from a copolymer of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate, and a copolymer of methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate. For example, an enteric polymer is poly(methacrylic acid co-ethyl acrylate)!:1 (Eudragit™ L 30 D-55 and Eudragit™ L 100-55).[0158] Other suitable examples of enteric coating coatings include beeswax and glyceryl monostearate; beeswax, shellac and cellulose; and cetyl alcohol, mastic and shellac, andN N 0N(1)r./)0shellac and stearic acid; polyvinyl acetate and ethyl cellulose; and neutral copolymer of polymethacrylic acid esters (Eudragit™ L 30D); copolymers of methacrylic acid and methacrylic acid methylester, or a neutral copolymer ofpolymethacrylic acid esters containing metallic stearates. Such coatings comprise mixtures of fats and fatty acids, shellac and shellac derivatives and the cellulose acid phthalates, e.g., those having a free carboxyl content.[0159] One or more plasticizers can be added to enteric polymers to increase their pliability and reduce brittleness, as known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include, for example, butyl citrates, triethyl citrate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl sebacate, polyethylene glycols (PEGs, such as PEG 6000), acetyl triethyl citrate, and triacetin. In one embodiment, the plasticizer is triethyl citrate. While some enteric materials are flexible and do not require plasticizers, more brittle polymers (e.g., Eudragit™ LIS types, Eudragit™ RL/RS, and Eudragit™ FS 30 D) benefit from plasticizers, for example ranging from between 5 wt.% and 30 wt.% based on the dry polymer mass, between about 8 wt.% and about 12 wt.% triethyl citrate with poly(methacrylic acid co-ethyl acrylate) 1:1.[0160] In certain embodiments, the enteric coatings comprise one or more anti-tacking agents (antiadherents) to reduce the tackiness of the film and prevent agglomeration, as it is known in the art. Suitable anti-tacking agents include, but are not limited to talc, glyceryl monostearate, fumed silica (e.g., Aerosil™ 200), precipitated silica (e.g., Sipemat™ PQ), and magnesium stearate. Anti-tacking agents can be used in any suitable quantity, for example ranging between about 10 wt.% and 100 wt.% based on dry polymer mass, between about 10 wt.% and about 50 wt.%, between about 10 wt.% and about 30 wt.%, or between about 15 wt.% and about 30 wt.%. For example, in one embodiment in ranges between 15 wt.% and about 30 wt.% based on dry polymer mass.[0161] One or more surfactants can also be added to an enteric coating mixture to increase substrate wettability and/or stabilize suspensions, as it is known in the art. Surfactants include Polysorbate 80, sorbitan monooleate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, and other surfactants described herein.[0162] The enteric coating can be formed by any suitable process. Coating processes include pan coating, fluid bed coating, and dry coating (e.g., heat dry coating and electrostatic dry coating), for example. Pan coating and fluid bed coating using solvent are well established processes. In liquid coating, the enteric material and optional excipients (e.g. pigments, plasticizers, anti-tacking agents) are mixed in an organic solvent or water to form a solutionN N 0N(1)r./)0or dispersion. The coating solution or dispersion is sprayed into solid dosage forms in a pan coater or a fluid bed dryer and dried by hot air. For example, in a Wurster fluid bed coating process, the coating fluid is sprayed from the bottom of the fluid bed apparatus. Alternatively, the coating fluid is applied by top spraying. In certain embodiments, a tangential spray is applied.[0163] The amount of enteric material applied is sufficient to achieve desired acid resistance and release characteristics. For example, in one embodiment the amount of enteric coating meets USP <711> requirements (USP 36-NF 31) for delayed-release dosage forms, thereby not releasing 10.0 wt.% of drug after 2 hours in 0.1 N HCl. In certain embodiments, the formulation releases at least 80% of the active in 20 minutes in pH 6.8 buffer solution, e.g. using a dissolution method of USP 36-NF 31 section <711>.[0164] In one embodiment, the enteric coating is present in an amount in a range between about 10% and 40%, or between 25% and about 35% as measured by the weight gain compared to the uncoated particle cores, or ranging between about 25% and about 31% weight gain, between about 27% and about 31% weight gain, or between about 28.5% and about 31% weight gain, based on the weight of the uncoated particle cores.[0165] The formulation can include a capsule shell in which the beads are disposed. Soft and hard capsule shells are known. In one embodiment, the capsule shell is a hard-capsule shell,e.g. a gelatin capsule shell or a vegetable-based hard capsule shell. In certain embodiments, the capsule shell comprises one or more enteric coatings described herein. During accelerated storage, gelatin capsules may collapse. Thus, in certain embodiments, the formulation can include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsule shell.[0166] Thus, for example, one embodiment combining various of the features described above includes a pharmaceutical dosage form comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads, the beads comprising a core comprising xanomeline tartrate, a filler (optionally microcrystalline cellulose), a binder (optionally hypromellose), and an enteric coating (optionally Eudragit™ L 30 D-55) surrounding the core, wherein the plurality of beads has a distribution of particle sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, wherein the enteric coating ranges between about 20% and about 40% based on the weight of the bead cores, and wherein the beads are disposed in a capsule shell.Bead size and shape[0167] The plurality of beads has a distribution of particle sizes. The plurality of beads has bead shapes. The plurality of beads has a distribution of coating thicknesses when present.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0168] Beads having a distribution of particle sizes were shown to exhibit advantageous pharmacokinetics. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is contemplated that the pharmacokinetics are influenced by the plurality of beads having a distribution of core sizes. [0169] In one embodiment, the particle sizes of the beads range between about 0.4 mm and about 1.2 mm, such as between about 0.4 mm and about 0.5 mm, between about 0.5 mm and about 0.6 mm, between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm, between about 0.7 mm and about0.8 mm, between about 0.8 mm and about 0.9 mm, between about 0.9 mm and about 1.0 mm, between about 1.0 mm and about 1.1 mm, or between about 1.1 mm and about 1.2 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the xanomeline beads is between about 0.425 mm and about1.18 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the xanomeline beads is between about 0.6 mm and about 0.85 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the trospium beads is between about0.425 mm and about 1.18 mm. In certain embodiments, the size of the trospium beads is between about 0.6 mm and about 0.85 mm.[0170] The beads or bead mixtures may be used, for example, in suspensions, filled into capsules, compressed into tablets, or filled into sachets. One or more types of modified release beads can be mixed together and encapsulated, or used as a sprinkle on the subject\\'s food. In certain embodiments, the oral solid dosage form may be any of these forms. In certain embodiments, the dosage form is a capsule.[0171] As the particle size of the beads becomes too small, the variability in content of the active increases. As the particle size becomes too large, the beads are too large for drug products labeled to be administered via sprinkling (e.g., on applesauce or other soft foods, such as jellies) and swallowed without chewing, or administered via an enteral feeding tube. Also, as the particle size increases, the larger particles get coated more than the smaller particles, resulting in lower relative assay compared to smaller particles. To compensate, relatively more beads are needed to meet the label strength per capsule. Filling a capsule shell with sufficient large particles to meet the label strength per capsule becomes difficult or impossible (e.g. to fill a size O capsule to a 75-mg strength of xanomeline free base).[0172] In one embodiment, the beads are formulated into capsules, e.g., with an encapsulation machine. Various capsule sizes may accommodate the strength and fill weight of the target formulations. Capsule size ranges from 00 to 5 for fill weights ranging between about 15 mg and about 630 mg.[0173] The beads can be sorted (e.g., via sieving) to a desired particle size. In certain embodiments, the particle size range is any particle size range or combination thereofN N 0N(1)r./)0described above regarding the cores. In one embodiment, the particle size range is the same as the particle size range of the uncoated cores. For example, the beads can be sieved such that 5% or less of the bead cores by weight are retained on a #12 mesh (1.68 mm) screen and 10% or less by weight pass through a #20 mesh (0.84 mm) screen.Method of Making[0174] Provided is a method for preparing an oral pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing beads comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads comprising xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a plurality oftrospium beads comprising a salt of trospium, such as trospium chloride. In certain embodiments, the method further comprises formulating the admixed beads into capsules.[0175] Also disclosed herein are a method for preparing the dosage form, comprising coating a core comprising xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an excipient with an enteric polymer to form the enteric coating, and coating a core comprising trospium chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an excipient with an enteric polymer to form the enteric coating. Optionally, the core can be formed by a wet granulation method. Optionally, drug beads are sorted (e.g., via sieving) to a desired particle size range before enteric coating, and optionally again following enteric coating.[0176] The drug beads may be made by different processes including, but not limited to, spheronizing an extruded wet mass and coating of inert core spheres in a fluidized bed. In certain embodiments, the beads are prepared by extrusion and spheronization.[0177] The beads are formulated to flow freely and to be compatible with modem encapsulation equipment. In some embodiments, the beads are blended together to form a uniform mixture that can be filled into capsules in a single stage. In other embodiments, the beads are filled separately into capsules using a two-stage capsule filler.[0178] The cores comprising xanomeline or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be formed by any suitable process. In one embodiment, the core is formed by granulating a mixture ofxanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient and milling to a desired particle size range. In another embodiment, the core can be formed by extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient.[0179] The cores comprising trospium chloride or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be formed by any suitable process. In one embodiment, the core is formed by granulating a mixture oftrospium chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipientN N 0N(1)r./)0and milling to a desired particle size range. In another embodiment, the core can be formed by extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of trospiurn chloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with an excipient.[0180] Granulating processes can include fluid bed granulation, wet granulation, hot melt granulation, and spray congealing, for example. Other processes include slugging and roller compaction. The mixtures to be granulated can first be dry-blended. The dry-blended dry ingredients can be mixed with water before extrusion.[0181] Extrusion and spheronization of a mixture of xanomeline or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and trospiurn chloride with an excipient provides desirable cores with a distribution of particle sizes as described herein and one or more other desirable properties. In certain embodiments, short processing times can lead to a more stable product. For example, reducing spheronization reduces the friction and related heat. Reducing the time that the product is exposed to air (either when moist and/or before packaging) also diminishes oxidation. On the other hand, rapid processing by extrusion and spheronization can lead to a poor-quality product, for example in having a large fraction of the bead cores falling outside a desired particle size range. The moisture absorbed by spheronization aids (which happens over time) influences the spheronization characteristics of the beads.[0182] Accordingly, in one embodiment the moisture content of the granulation mixture, before drying, ranging between about 20 wt.% and about 40 wt.%, such as between 25 wt.% and about 35 wt.%, between about 28 wt.% and about 32 wt.%, at least about 28 wt.%, at least about 28.5, between about 20 wt.% and about 40 wt.%, between about 25 wt.% and about 35 wt.%, between about 27 wt.% and about 31 wt.%, or between about 28.5 wt.% and about 31 wt.%.[0183] In certain embodiments, the wet mass can be held before extrusion, for example to allow the spheronization aid to swell with granulating fluid. The hold time can be at least 15 minutes, such as at least 30 minutes, at least 45 minutes, or at least 60 minutes. In certain embodiments, the hold time ranging between about 15 minutes and about 120 minutes, such as between about 30 minutes and 100 minutes, or between 60 minutes and 90 minutes.[0184] As described above relating to cores, the method can include a step of sorting (e.g., by sieving) the cores before optional coating, to retain particles in a predetermined size range, for example sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.8 mm, such as between about0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, between about 0.8 mm and about 1.7 mm, or any range described herein.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0185] As described above relating to beads, the method can include a step of sorting (e.g., by sieving) the beads after optional coating, to retain particles in a size range, for example sizes ranging between about 0.7 mm and about 2.8 mm, such as between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, or between about 0.8 mm and about 1.7 mm, or any range described herein. [0186] In an extrusion and spheronization process, the following optional features can be employed, individually or in one or more combinations thereof. Water can be a granulation agent. Microcrystalline cellulose can be in the cores as a spheronization aid. Hypromellose can be included in the cores as a binder. The extrusion screen size can be 1.0 mm The friction plate of the spheronizer can be cross-hatched. The friction plate of the spheronizer can be cross-hatched with a square pitch of at least about 3 mm, or greater than about 3 mm, or at least about 4 mm, or greater than about 4 mm, or ranging between about 3 mm and about 7 mm, or about 5 mm The spheronization time can be less than about 5 minutes, or less than about 4 minutes, or less than about 3 minutes, or less than about 2 minutes, or up to 1 minute. The spheronized particles can include non-spherical particles (i.e. irregular shapes), for example a substantial fraction thereof, such as at least about 20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt.%, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at least about 60 wt.%, or at least about 70 wt.% thereof.[0187] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored with a desiccant, for example, pharmaceutical grades of silica gel, crystalline sodium, potassium or calcium aluminosilicate, colloidal silica, anhydrous calcium sulphate and the like.[0188] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored with an oxygen absorber.[0189] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored under a dry inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, argon, neon, xenon, krypton or a mixture thereof.[0190] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored under a reduced pressure in comparison with the external ambient air.[0191] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored at a reduced temperature, e.g., at refrigerated temperatures (e.g., 2 °C to 8 °C). In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored in such a manner have fewer impurities, such as Impurity A, than when stored at 25 °C.[0192] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is stored by a manufacturer, a distributor, a pharmacy, or a hospital at a temperature of between about 2 °C and about 8 °C prior to dispensing the oral pharmaceutical composition to the subject. In certainN N 0N(1)r./)0embodiments, after the oral pharmaceutical composition is dispensed to the subject, the pharmaceutical composition is stored at a temperature of between about 20 °C and about 2510193] Also provided is a method of stabilizing a pharmaceutical dosage form or composition as described herein comprising storing the dosage fonn at a ternperature of about 2 °C to about 8 °C.[0194] ln certain embodiments, a method for preparing a pharmaceutical dosage fom1 comprising xanomeline beads comprises forming a wet mass comprising xanomeline tartrate and an excipient, optionally microcrystalline cellulose, with a moisture content ranging between about 20 wt.% and about 40 vvt %, extmding and spheronizing the vvet mass comprising xanomeline tartrate and excipient to make cores, sorting the cores to a target particle size range, optionally between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm, coating the sorted cores with a polymer to fom1 beads comprising a core and an coating, and sorting the bead particles to a target particle size range, optionally between about 0.7 mm and about 2.5 mm.

Also provided is a method for treating a disorder ameliorated by activating muscarinic receptors in a subject in need thereof: comprising administering to the subject in need thereof any oral phannaceutical composition described herein.[0202] While activators of Ml and M4 muscarinic receptors have been suggested to be efficacious treatments for schizophrenia, the activation of muscarinic receptors located outside the brain has resulted in side effects w-hich barred xanomeline from the clinic. For instance, in both Phase I and subsequent trials, the muscarinic agonist xanomeline had unacceptable GI and other side effects linked to binding of muscarinic receptors in the body\\'s periphery. By combining a xanorneline with trnspium chloride, desired therapeutic effect is achieved while diminishing or eliminating the side effects associated with activating muscarinic receptors located outside the brain.[0203] TI1e tolerability ofxanomeline, a muscarinic activator, is increased by co\\xad administering trospium chloride, a muscarinic antagonist. The most common adverse events observed with administering xanomeline are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, and excessive salivation (so-called cholinergic adverse events). The disclosed compositionsN N 0N(1)r./)0reduced the incidence of these adverse events in humans, evincing increased xanomeline tolerability.[0204] In one embodiment, xanomeline is combined with trospium chloride to treat muscarinic disorders, ameliorating symptoms in response to muscarinic activation by xanomeline in living tissues found outside the brain. In an embodiment, such diseases or disorders include schizophrenia and diseases related to schizophrenia, cognitive disorders in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s, and pain such as nociceptive pain or neuropathic pain. The combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride is a safer method for treating those diseases shown to be responsive to activation of muscarinic receptors.[0205] In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat mood disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat movement disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat cognitive disorders, including enhancing cognitive function not associated with a specific pathology. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat attention disorders. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat pain. Outside disease treatment, enhancing attention accelerates learning and decreases fatigue due to both lack of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, such as jet lag. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride treat addictive disorders.[0206] In one embodiment, xanomeline combined with trospium chloride treat an animal. In a further embodiment, the animal is a mammal. In an embodiment, the mammal is a human being.[0207] In one embodiment, trospium chloride decreases the side effects associated with xanomeline. Such side effects include, but are not limited to, GI side effects, cardiac side effects, excessive sweating, and excessive salivation. Use of trospium with xanomeline allows the xanomeline to be used clinically when the xanomeline would not otherwise be used clinically due to its side effects. In another embodiment, use of trospium chloride with the xanomeline allows for the xanomeline to achieve a higher maximum tolerated dose than xanomeline would otherwise achieve.[0208] Various time and resource intensive methods demonstrated the efficacy of the combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride. For example, animal models demonstrate the efficacy of new therapeutics for schizophrenia, including both pharmacological models (e.g., ketamine model) and genetic models (e.g., DISCl mouse). Likewise, animal models including rodents, dogs and non-human primates demonstrate the side effect profile ofN N 0N(1)r./)0pharmacological agents. Animal models are an experimental proxy for humans but maysuffer from deficiencies in the physiological differences between human and animals and thus may have limited predictive power for human experiments, particularly for central nervous system disorders. Alternatively, the disclosed combination can be tried in controlled clinical trials of people. Standard measures based on patient self-report can be used by those skilled in the art to assess various side effects such as GI discomfort. As another example, objective physiological measures (e.g., EKGs) may be used by those skilled in the art. A set of standard measures has also been developed to assess schizophrenia symptoms including the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Typically, clinical trials are double blinded, where one group of patients receives an inactive placebo and the other group the active intervention. [0209] Before administering the claimed combinations, patients may have a lead-in period from one to fourteen days, during which lead-in period trospium chloride is given alone. In one embodiment, the trospium chloride is administered for one or more dose periods before administering xanomeline to accumulate trospium chloride in the body, or for the trospium chloride to reach or approach steady-state exposure levels. This accumulation, or higher exposure levels of the trospium chloride, increases the blockade of muscarinic receptors outside of the brain and reduces adverse events when xanomeline is administered. In another embodiment, the trospium chloride is administered for one or more days before xanomeline. [0210] In one embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 6 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 5 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 4 times during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient 3 times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient twice during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, xanomeline and trospium chloride are administered to a patient once during a 24-hour period.[0211] In one embodiment, an extended release formulation of trospium chloride is used in combination with xanomeline. In another embodiment, trospium chloride extended release is administered to a patient from one time to five times during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, trospium chloride extended release is administered from one to three times during a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, from five milligrams to 400 milligrams of trospium chloride extended release is used during a 24-hour period. In an embodiment, fromN N 0N(1)r./)020 milligrams to 200 milligrams of trospium chloride extended release is used during a 24- hour period.[0212] In one embodiment, 225 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 100 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 30 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 125 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 200 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 200 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 250 mg xanomeline and 60 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 250 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 300 mg xanomeline and 40 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. In another embodiment, 300 mg xanomeline and 80 mg trospium chloride are administered to a patient in a 24-hour period. [0213] Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by small increments until a balance between therapeutic effect and side effects is attained. While the subject is being treated, the health of the patient may be monitored by measuring one or more of the relevant indices at predetermined times during the treatment period. Treatment, including composition, amounts, times of administration and formulation, may be adjusted per such monitoring. The patient may be periodically reevaluated to determine improvement by measuring the same parameters. Adjustments to the disclosed composition administered and possibly to the time of administration may be made based on these reevaluations.EXAMPLES[0214] The following examples are provided for illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.Example 1 - Immediate Release Beads[0215] Beads were prepared for xanomeline tartrate (Table 1) and trospium chloride (Table 2).N N0Table 1: Xanomeline tartrate (66%) Bead without TalcIngredient% w/w (dry basis)g/batchXanomeline tartrate6699Microcrystalline cellulose3451Purified water*(30)(45)Total:100150Ingredient% w/w (dry basis)g/batchXanomeline tartrate6699Microcrystalline cellulose3451Purified water*(30)(45)Total:100150N(1)r./)0*Removed during drying.Table 2: Trospium chloride (17.7%) Bead without TalcIngredient% w/w (dry basis)g/batchTrospium chloride17.717.7Microcrystalline cellulose3535Lactose monohydrate47.347.3Purified water*(45)(45)Total:100100*Removed during drying.[0216] The powders were screened using Quadro Comil Model 197 equipped with 457-µm round hole screen, 0.2-inch spacer at 1625 rpm and mixed for 2 min in a Hobart low shear mixer/granulator (model N-50) at a fixed speed of 60 rpm. The dry blending step is optional, as blend uniformity is driven by subsequent wet granulation. Beads were screened by hand through a 40 mesh (425 µm) sieve.[0217] Wetting was carried out in the Hobart. The water was added using a Cole-Parmer peristaltic pump. Water addition rate (amount of water /dose time) is a process variable. [0218] The wet mass was extruded through a perforated screen (dome configuration) single screw extruder using a LCI Multi Granulator MG-55 at 30 rpm (shaft speed). The wet mass was extruded directly after wetting. Hold time, shaft speed, and extrusion rate (load) were process variables.[0219] The extrudates were placed into a LCI Marumerizer (spheronizer) QJ-230T equipped with 2.0 mm friction plate. The extrudates were spheronized at different plate speed for a total of not more than 4 minutes. Spheronization speed and time are process variables. [0220] The beads were dried using an Aeromatic™ Strea-1 fluid bed at inlet temperature of 60 °C until a water content of not more than 3% was obtained. Because beads melted after a few minutes at 60 °C, the beads were dried at 30 °C.N N0[0221] Water content was evaluated gravimetrically by loss-on-drying (LOD) using a MettlerN000-.::j\\'\" N NN N 0NToledo halogen Moisture Analyser, type HR83.

The beads in size between sieves 1.18 mm and 0.425 mm were retained for further analysis.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0225] The morphology and surface characteristics of beads were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JSM-6010LV InTouchScope™ (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, JP) microscope with a back-scattered electron detector (BES). Samples were placed on metallic stubs using double-sided carbon conductive tape. The images were obtained with accelerating voltages of 20 kV under low vacuum (60 Pa) and magnification 30x.[0226] Bulk and tapped density were determined in duplicate using the USP <616> method using a tapped density tester (N 1000, Copley Scientific). The bulk density was measured from the volume of a known mass of powder sample in a graduated cylinder. The tapped density was measured by mechanically tapping the measuring cylinder until the volume changed no further.[0227] The powder flow properties were evaluated using the Carr\\'s Compressibility Index and Hausner ratio, both derived using the measured values for bulk and tapped density Carr\\'s Compressibility Index (CI) was calculated using bulk and tapped density data when fitted into the equation: Compressibility Index= (Tapped density - Bulk density)/ Tapped density x 100%. Hausner Ratio (H) was calculated as the ratio of tapped to bulk density. Capsules were analyzed for appearance, assay, related substances, water content, and dissolution. FIG. 1 shows the stability schedule and protocol for xanomeline/trospium capsules.[0228] The beads were further sized between 0.6 mm and 0.85 mm. Some beads exhibited similar morphological properties. Modifications in some other beads decreased the density of beads and lead to rough surfaces and loss of sphericity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images ofxanomeline tartrate 66% beads (FIG. 2) trospium chloride 17.7% beads (FIG. 3) at 30x magnification showed that the beads are sized between 0.6 mm and 0.85 mm These beads were used in xanomeline/trospium capsules. Particle size distribution (PSD) of beads was determined by mechanical sieving. As shown in Table 10, most beads for both APis were sized between 0.425 and 1.18 mmTable 10: Particle Size Distribution by Mechanical Sieving of BeadsSieve No. (openingdiameter)% Retained66% Xanomeline tartrate17.7% Trospium chloride16 mesh (1.18 mm)8.10.440 mesh (0.425 mm)90.697.3Receiver1.32.3Total:100100N N0[0229] Table 11 shows densities and flow properties of beads collected between 0.425 mmNand 1.18 mm sieves.

hard-shell capsules were stable for at least 12 months 25°C/60 i>RH. Based on available data, a shelf-life of 15 months at 25°C/60(%RH is proposed.[0232] The dissolution results show that the two compounds release quickly, ·which may increase their bioavailability, and that they also release at comparable rates despite substantial differences in compositions between the two head formulations. Both xanomeline a.nd trospium chloride have low bioavailahilities, and rapid relemse can increase bioavailability by overwhelming saturable processes that limit absorption into the general circulation.10233] An unknown xanomeline impurity \\\\Vith a relative retention time of about 1.09 was observed during stability studies of the combination drug products. The impurity was first observed during testing at the three-month time point for the 50 mg xanomeline/ l O mg trospium chloride drng product and at the initial time point for the other three combination products, both of which occurred at the same time. The impurity peak increased both with time and with increasing storage ternperature. The irnpurity had not been observed before the present studies.10234] Preliminary studies suggest that the RRT 1.09 impurity is 3-[(4-hexyloxy)-1,2,5- thiadiazol-3-yl]-5-hydroxyl-1-methy!pyridin-l-ium (C14l-hoN302S+, MW ,cc 294.1271 Da):N N 0N(1)r./)0\\'N OHVN&O10235] The RRT 1.09 impurity is ahydroxylated version of Compound V (C14H20N3OS\\', MW\\'\" 278.1322 Da), which is the penultimate intermediate in the synthesis of xanomeline V\\\\ th negative mutagenic potential:VV\\'NNbO.-3-r:.f[0236] To reduce the presence of the impurity, the storage temperature for the drug product was lowered.

The primary objectives of this study were (1) to assess the safety and tolerability of administering, for 7 days, 225 mg daily of xanomeline with 40 mg daily of trospium chloride, versus administering 225 mg daily of xanomeline alone for 7 days; and (2) to determine whether adding trospium 40 mg daily (20 mg BID) to xanomeline 225 mg daily (75 mg TID) over 7 days significantly reduces peripheral cholinergic side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, excess salivation) versus xanomeline 225 mg daily, alone.

In this study, the co-administration of trospium chloride with xanomeline led to a statistically00-.::j\\'\"N N N N 0Nsignificant (p = 0.016) 43% reduction in the incidence rate of cholinergic adverse events compared to xanomeline co-administered with placebo. In the xanomeline + placebo arm of the study, 63% of subjects reported at least one cholinergic adverse event, compared to only 34% of subjects reporting such an event in the xanomeline + trospium chloride arm of the study.[0240] Further, in the study, each kind of individual cholinergic adverse event also had a decreased incidence rate in subjects administered xanomeline + trospium chloride, compared to the incidence rate in subjects administered xanomeline +placebo.The decrease in incidence rate of sweating was statistically significant on its own, at 20.0% in the xanomeline+ trospium chloride arm, down from 48.5% in the xanomeline + placebo arm, which was a 59% reduction (p = 0.013).[0241] The overall cholinergic adverse event rate in the xanomeline + trospium chloride arm of the study was very similar to the 32% incidence rate reported during the two-day run-in period for subjects on placebo+ placebo. Although these two data points did not occur during different periods of the study, the fact that the cholinergic adverse event rate was comparable to that of placebo suggests that the 43% reduction in adverse events due to trospium chloride may have been close to the maximum reduction possible in this study.[0242] Table 19 shows the incidence and number of cholinergic adverse events in the evaluable population of the study was as follows, with all p-values based on a chi-squared test, except those marked with an*, which were based on a Fisher\\'s exact test.Table 19: Cholinergic adverse eventsXanomeline +placebo (n = 34)Xanomeline + Trospium(n = 35)Category(n [%] [# of events])(n [%] [# of events])P-value fordifference%ReductionAny21 (63.6%) 6412 (34.3%) 330.015546%N N 0N(1)r./)0TEAEsNausea8 (24.2%) 116(17.1%)80.469329%Vomiting5 (15.2%) 52 (5.7%) 20.2522*62%Diarrhea7 (21.2%) 82 (5.7%) 40.0794*73%Sweating16 (48.5%) 247 (20.0%) 80.013159%Salivation12 (36.4%) 169 (25.7%) 110.34239%[0243] In addition to evaluating whether adding trospium chloride increased the tolerability of xanomeline, the study also provided data about the overall safety and tolerability of xanomeline + trospium chloride. Table 20 shows that overall the combination was well tolerated with no severe adverse events and no serious adverse events, and with most adverse events being mild.Table 20: TolerabilityXanomeline + placeboXanomeline + TrospiumCategory (n (%)#events)(N = 33)(N = 35)Subjects with any TEAE27 (81.8) 10823 (65.7) 73Max Severity of TEAEMild22 (66.7) NIA20 (57.1) NIAModerate5 (15.2) NIA3 (8.6) NIASevere0 (0.0)0 (0.0)Any clinically significant TEAE5 (15.2) 53 (8.6) 6Any study drug related TEAE23 (69.7) 9218 (51.4) 57Max severity of study drug related TEAEMild19 (5716) NIA15 (42.9) NIAModerate4(12.l)NIA3 (8.6) NIASevereO (0.0) NIAO (0.0) NIAAny SAE0 (0.0)0 (0.0)AE leading to discontinuation(DIC)2(6.1)21 (2.9) 1Study drug related AE leading toDIC1 (3.0) 10 (0.0)N N 0N(1)r./)0[0244] The tolerability profile found in this study allowed future studies of the combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride to proceed.Example 5-KAR-003 Phase I Study ofKarXT, a xanomeline + trospium combined formulation[0245] This study was a Phase 1, randomized, multiple-dose, adaptive design, inpatient study to assess the safety and tolerability of KarXT in normal healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 years. Subjects signed the informed consent and underwent Screening assessments onDays -21 to -1. Upon successfully completing all Screening assessments, subjects returned to the study clinic on Day O for baseline safety assessments and enrollment into the study and were randomized 3:1 in each cohort into one of two treatment arms: KarXT or placebo.Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts (Cohort 1, 2, 3, or 4).[0246] Study drug was administered BID on Days 1 through 7. A combination dosage formulation of both xanomeline and trospium was used in all cohorts. All cohorts began with a 2-day lead-in of KarXT 50/20 BID (for subjects randomized to active treatment); after the 2-day lead-in period, the unblinded pharmacist dispensed the study drug to each subject per the subject\\'s randomization assignment for 5 days of specified cohort dosing, for a total of 7 days of treatment. Matching placebo was administered throughout the study to maintain the blind. A sentinel group was introduced to the study for Cohorts 2 to 4 and was monitored for safety and tolerability by the Data Safety Evaluation Group (DSEG), such that about 30% of the proposed cohort was treated and assessed for safety before the rest of the cohort was dosed. Subjects and study clinic staff were blinded to treatment. The Dose Selection Committee (DSC) was unblinded to decide dosing for subsequent treatment groups.[0247] Serial blood samples for the PK assessment of xanomeline and trospium were drawn on Days 1, 3, and 7. More blood was sampled at routine intervals for monitoring trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospium and clinical laboratory assessments. On Day 1, saliva volume was collected twice. A saliva volume was measured predose on Day 1 and then daily (afternoon) on Days 1 through 7 at about the same time of day to avoid diurnal variations. Other assessments included pupil size measurements and Bristol stool scale assessments. Subjects remained in the study clinic for the full duration of treatment (7 days). Following a safety assessment on Day 8, subjects were discharged from the study clinic, and asked to return about 14 days after administration of study drug for a final safety assessment. [0248] During the study, following the 2-day lead-in of KarXT 50/20 BID (for subjects randomized to active treatment) in each cohort, subjects were dosed as follows:N N0•In Cohort 1, subjects completed Days 3 through 7 of dosing of KarXT 100/20 BID (totalNdaily dose (TDD) of 200 mg xanomeline plus 40 mg trospium) or placebo.(1)r:/\\'.J.•In Cohort 2, the sentinel group (Group 2a) discontinued dosing after the Day 4 morningdose. The dosage for subjects in Cohort 2 was KarXT 150/20 BID (TDD of 300 mg000-.::j\\'\" N NN N 0Nxanomeline plus 40 mg trospium) or placebo. Dosing of Cohort 2 was discontinued (DSEG decision based on observed tolerability concerns). The study proceeded to dosing of the Cohort 3 sentinel group (Group 3a) as the DSC determined that further dosing of Cohort 2 with KarXT 150/20 BID was unlikely to be tolerated well enough to warrant further developing this dose combination for a clinical population.In Cohort 3, the sentinel group (Group 3a) completed Days 3 through 7 of dosingof KarXT 150/40 BID (TDD of 300 mg xanomeline plus 80 mg trospium) or placebo. The second group in Cohort 3 (Group 3b) discontinued dosing after the Day 5 morning dose.In Cohort 4, the sentinel group (Group 4a), the second group (Group 4b), and the remaining group (Group 4c) completed Days 3 through 7 of dosing ofKarXT 125/40 BID (TDD of 250 mg xanomeline plus 80 mg trospium) or placebo.[0249] Ninety-six subjects were planned, 248 subjects were screened, 69 subjects were randomized, 51 subjects completed the study, and 18 subjects discontinued the study. The population included male and female healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years at screening with a body mass index of 18 to 40 kg/m2. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had a history of irritable bowel syndrome or serious constipation requiring treatment within 6 months before Screening. Subjects were also excluded from the study if they had a history or presence of any disease or condition, including psychiatric or neurological diseases that, in the Investigator\\'s opinion, would have jeopardized the subject\\'s safety or the study\\'s validity.

The PK parameters listed below were calculated from the individual xanomeline and trospium concentration-time profiles by standard non-compartmental methods. Dose-normalized parameters were calculated for Crnax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values. During the study, additional blood samples for monitoring trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospiumwere collected on Days 2, 4, 5, and 6 before the morning dose and before discharge on Day 8. [0251] Safety evaluations included spontaneously reported adverse events, ECGs, laboratory assessments, vital signs, assessments of saliva volumes, Bristol stool scale, pupil size, and physical examinations. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) summarized the continuous data by treatment group. Geometric mean (GM), geometric percent coefficient of variation (CV%), quartiles, or box plots were generated. The count and frequency tabulated categorical measurements, although formal statistics were not conducted.[0252] Treatment groups were summarized as follows unless otherwise specified: KarXT 50/20 BID (for adverse events and Day 1 PK summaries only), KarXT 100/20 BID, KarXT 125/40 BID, KarXT 150/20 BID, KarXT 150/40 BID, and placebo (Empty Vcaps® Plus Capsules and Capsugel®; all cohort placebo groups combined). The safety evaluation was based on spontaneously reported adverse events, ECGs, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. Exploratory analyses of saliva volumes, Bristol stool scale, and pupil size were also conducted.N N 0N(1)r./)0[0253] Xanomeline was well absorbed into systemic circulation following oral administration of the KAR-003 formulation at all dosages. Peak concentrations of xanomeline were observed at a median time of 2 hours across all treatment groups and study days.[0254] Median t112 values for xanomeline were similar between treatment groups and across study days, indicating that t112 was not dose-dependent. Median t112 ranged from 3.4 to 5.8 hours.[0255] GM xanomeline exposures did not increase dose-proportionally on Day 3 from 100 to 150 mg when xanomeline was administered with 20 mg trospium, or from 125 to 150 mg when administered with 40 mg trospium. Lower xanomeline exposures were observed following treatment with KarXT 150/40 compared to KarXT 125/40. Day 3 GM xanomeline exposures (Crnax, AUCo-last, and AUC0-12hr) were similar when the 150 mg xanomeline dose was administered with 20 and 40 mg trospium. On Day 7, GM xanomeline exposures increased slightly more than dose-proportionally from 125 to 150 mg when xanomeline was administered with 40 mg trospium.[0256] Minimal to no xanomeline accumulated in plasma from Day 3 to Day 7 following treatment with KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID; however, there was accumulation following administration of KarXT 150/40 BID in 3 of the 4 subjects who completed the study. The mean accumulation ratios for the KarXT 150/40 BID group were 366.2% for RAUC and 445.4% for RCrnax.Example 6-  Xanomeline pharmacokinetics ofKAR-003 compared to KAR-001 [0257] Comparing xanomeline GM exposures between KAR-001 (75 mg xanomeline TID±20 mg trospium BID) and the KarXT 100/20 BID group from KAR-003 showed that Crnax values and AUCo-6hr (KAR-003) or AUCo-tau (KAR-001) values were greater in KAR-003 (Days 3 and 7) than the corresponding exposures from KAR-001 (Days 3 and 9). The median Trnax was observed at 2 hours in both studies and both days (Days 3 and 9 for KAR-001, and Days 3 and 7 for KAR-003). These data indicate that the KarXT formulation enhanced xanomeline exposures.[0258] Trospium was absorbed into systemic circulation following oral administration of the KarXT formulation at all dosages. Peak concentrations of trospium were observed at a median time of 1.0 hour across all treatment groups and study days.[0259] Median t112 values for trospium were similar between treatment groups on Day 3, with values ranging between 4.1 and 4.8 hours. On Day 7, median t112 values were similar for theN N 0N(1)r./)0KarXT 100/20 BID (4.9 hours) and KarXT 125/40 BID (4.5 hours) treatments, but were slightly longer for the KarXT 150/40 BID group (7.1 hours).[0260] GM trospium exposures increased in slightly less than dose-proportionally on Day 3 from 20 to 40 mg when administered with 150 mg xanomeline. Day 3 GM trospium exposures (Crnax, AUCo-last, and AUC0-12hr) were greater when the 20 mg BID dose of trospium was administered with 100 mg BID xanomeline compared to 150 mg BID xanomeline. Day 3 GM trospium exposures were similar when the 40 mg trospium BID dose was given with 125 mg xanomeline BID and 150 mg xanomeline BID.[0261] Trospium did not accumulate in plasma from Day 3 to Day 7 following administration ofKarXT 100/20 BID, KarXT 125/40 BID, and KarXT 150/40 BID. Trospium accumulated in plasma from Day 1 to Day 7 for the KarXT 100/20 BID group. Mean Day 7/Day 1 accumulation ratios were 348.7% (RAUC) and 379.9% (RCrnax).[0262] Comparing trospium GM exposures between KAR-001 and the KarXT 100/20 BID group from KAR-003 showed that Crnax and AUC0-12hr values from KAR-003 were greater than the corresponding exposures from KAR-001 on both days (Days 3 and 9 for KAR-001 and Days 3 and 7 for KAR-003). The median Trnax for trospium was observed at 1.0 hour in both studies on both days. These data indicate that the KarXT formulation enhanced trospium exposures.[0263] All cohorts of KAR-003 started with a 2-day lead-in period ofKarXT 50/20 BID for subjects randomized to KarXT. FIG. 42 presents the mean(± SD) xanomeline PK concentrations, and Table 22 summarizes xanomeline PK parameters on Day 1 forKarXT 50/20 BID treatment of all cohorts for the PK Population. No sample collected beforeadministering the first dose of xanomeline on Day 1 displayed measurable concentrations of xanomeline. Concentrations of xanomeline were quantifiable (>50 pg/mL) at all time points after administering the Day 1 morning dose through 12 hours.Table 22: Xanomeline PK Parameters on Day 1 for KarXT 50/20 BID (All Cohorts)CharacteristicnStatisticCrnax (pg/mL)531972.3 (131.8)Tmax (h)532.0 (1.0, 8.0)t112 (h)483.4 (2.0, 4.6)AUCo-Iast (h*pg/mL)5310775.5 (102.2)AUC0-12hr (h*pg/mL)5210810.3 (103.5)NN0IAUCo-inf (h*pg/mL)4812836.1 (97.7)N(1)r./)0[0264] FIG. 43 presents the mean(± SD) xanomeline PK concentrations by treatment on Day 3 for the PK population, and Table 23 summarizes these parameters. Concentrations of xanomeline were quantifiable in samples before administering the morning dose of study drug on Day 3 and at all time points after administering the Day 3 morning dose through 12 hours for all cohorts, except for one subject who had a xanomeline plasma concentration<50.0 pg/mL at 12 hours post-dose. Inter-subject variability ranged from 23.7% to 58.2% (CV%) for Tmax, 79.8% to 136.3% (geometric CV%) for Cmax, 21.6% to 26.3% (CV%) for t112, and 77.1% to 96.1% (geometric CV%) for AUC0-12hr across the four treatment groups. The median Tmax for xanomeline on Day 3 was 2 hours for the KarXT 100/20 BID,KarXT 125/40 BID, KarXT 150/20 BID, and KarXT 150/40 BID groups.

Individual t112 values ranged from 3.1 to 11.9 hours across the KarXT 100/20 BID, KarXT 150/40 BID, and KarXT 125/40 BID groups.[0281] As observed on Day 3, comparing Day 7 trospium exposures following administration of 40 mg trospium BID with either 125 mg (Cohort 4) or 150 mg (Cohort 3) xanomeline BID showed that the GM Cmax, AUCo-last, and AUC0-12hr for trospium were similar when trospium was adminstered with 125 and 150 mg xanomeline BID.[0282] Table 31 summarizes trospium PK accumulation ratios (Day 7/Day 3; Day 7/Day 1) by treatment for the PK Population. Based upon mean trospium PK accumulation ratios, trospium accumulated minimally in the plasma from Day 3 to Day 7 following administration of KarXT 100/20 BID (Cohort 1), and had little to no accumulation following administration ofKarXT 125/40 BID (Cohort 4) and KarXT 150/40 BID (Cohort 3). Two subjects showed lower exposures on Day 7 compared to Day 3 in the KarXT 100/20 BID group.[0283] Accumulation ratios from Day 3 to Day 7 varied widely between subjects in the KarXT 125/40 BID and KarXT 150/20 BID groups. Mean accumulation ratios ranged from 108.6% to 141.4% for RAUC and from 111.0% to 135.8% for RCmax. Trospium accumulated moderately in the plasma from Day 1 to Day 7 for the KarXT 100/20 BID group. All but one subject showed higher trospium exposures on Day 7 compared to Day 1. Mean accumulation ratios were 348.7% for RAUC and 379.9% for RCmax. The possible effect of the increase in xanomeline dose (from 50 mg BID to 100 mg BID beginning on Day 3) on the PK and bioavailability of trospium cannot be ruled out as contributing to the increased exposures from Day 1 to Day 7.N N 0N(1)r./)0Table 31: Trospium PK Accumulation Ratios (Day 7/Day 3; Day7/Day 1) by TreatmentCohort 1KarXT 100/20 BIDCohort 2 KarXT150/20 BID [1]Cohort 3 KarXT150/40 BID [2]Cohort 4KarXT 125/40 BIDStatisticnMean(SD)nMean(SD)nMean(SD)nMean(SD)Day 71Day 3RAUC (%)16141.4NIANIA4108.618125.0(56.6)(NIA)(39.0)(84.4)RCrnax (%)16135.8NIANIA4111.018119.9(70.5)(NIA)(67.8)(91.0)Day 71Day 1RAUC (%)15348.7NIANIANIANIANIANIA(242.9)(NIA)(NIA)(NIA)RCrnax (%)16379.89NIANIANIANIANIANIA(266.0)(NIA)(NIA)(NIA)Pharmacokinetic accumulation ratios of Day7IDay3: RAUC=100*Day 7 AUCo-12hrlDay 3 AUC0-12hr.

The Day 3 GM trospium exposures from KAR-003 (Table 32) are also -2.4- to 3.3-fold higher than those obtained from KAR-001 (Table 33). Comparing Day 7 GM exposures for trospium for the KarXT 100120 BID cohort (Cohort 1) from KAR-003 (Table 32) with Day 9 exposures from the xanomeline + trospium arm from KAR-001 (Table 33) indicates that exposures were once again higher (by approximately 3.5- to 4.3-fold) than those obtained from KAR-001. [0286] The median Tmax for trospium was 1.0 hour on Day 3 and Day 7 for the KarXT 100120 BID group for KAR-003 and on Day 3 and Day 9 for the xanomeline + trospium arm for KAR-001. Median Tmax for trospium was lower (1.0 hour) on Day 1 for the KarXT 50120BID group (KAR-003) compared to the median Tmax for trospium (3.0 hours on Day 1 for the trospium alone arm (KAR-001).[0287] Table 32 summarizes a subset of KAR-003 trospium PK parameters for theKarXT 50120 BID treatment (all cohorts) on Day 1 and for the KarXT 100120 BID treatment on Day 3 and Day 7 for the PK Population.

The overall subject incidence of cholinergic TEAEs was similar between the xanomeline + trospium arm (12 [34.3%] subjects) in KAR-001, the KarXT 100/20 BID group (7 [38.9%] subjects), and the KarXT 125/40 BID group (6 [33.3%] subjects).Table 34: KAR-001 Incidence of Cholinergic Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term - Safety PopulationSystem Organ Class Preferred TermXanomeline Alone [1](n = 34)n (%) #Xanomeline +Trospium [2](n = 35)n(%)#Total (n = 69)n (%) #Subjects with any TEAEs21 (61.8) 6412 (34.3) 3333 (47.8) 97Gastrointestinal disorders18 (52.9) 4012 (34.3) 2530 (43.5) 65Salivary hypersecretion12 (35.3) 169 (25.7) 1121 (30.4) 27Nausea8 (23.5) 116(17.1)814 (20.3) 19N N 0N(1)r./)0Diarrhea7 (20.6) 82 (5.7) 49 (13.0) 12Vomiting5 (14.7) 52 (5.7) 27 (10.1) 7Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders16 (47.1) 247 (20.0) 823 (33.3) 32Hyperhidrosis16 (47.1) 247 (20.0) 823 (33.3) 32Percentage was calculated from number of subjects in the column header as the denominator.# was the number of individual occurrences of the TEAE. The TEAEs were defined as adverse events that happened for the first time after dosing of study drug, or existed before but worsened in severity or relationship to study drug after dosing. For noncholinergic adverse events, the first dose of any study drug (Day 1) was used, and for cholinergic adverse events, the first dose of xanomeline (Day 3) was used. Cholinergic adverse events had the additional specification that the start of the adverse event must have been within 24 hours (inclusive) of the last dose to be treatment-emergent. At each level of summation (total, system organ class term, preferred term), subjects who reported more than one adverse event were counted only once. During the study, a subject could have contributed to more than one preferred term.In KAR-001, xanomeline dosing started on Day 3. Hence Day 3 was the first day of xanomeline dosing and Day 9 was the seventh day of xanomeline dosing.In KAR-001, the xanomeline-alone treatment arm received two placebo capsules TID during the 2-day lead-in phase, then xanomeline 75 mg TID (TDD 225 mg) and placebo on Days 3 through 9.In KAR-001, the xanomeline + trospium arm received trospium 20 mg BID (TDD 40 mg) and placebo BID; and two placebo capsules QD during the 2-day lead-in phase; then xanomeline 75 mg TID and trospium 20 mg BID (TDD 40 mg) and placebo QDon Days 3 through 9.[0289] Subject incidence of salivary hypersecretion, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea was higher in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 compared to the KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups. Salivary hypersecretion occurred in 25.7% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001, 5.6% of subjects in the KarXT 100/20 BID group, and no subjects in the KarXT 125/40 BID group. Hyperhidrosis occurred in 20.0% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001, 5.6% of subjects in the KarXT 100/20 BID group, and 11.1% of subjects in the KarXT 125/40 BID group. Diarrhea occurredN N 0N(1)r./)0in 5.7% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001, and no subjects in the KarXT 100/20 BID group or the KarXT 125/40 BID group.[0290] The xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 showed no other apparent trends compared to the KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups for nausea and vomiting. Nausea occurred in 17.1% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 and 22.2% of subjects in each KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups. Vomiting occurred in 5.7% of subjects in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001, 27.8% of subjects in the KarXT 100/20 BID group, and 5.6% of subjects in the KarXT 125/40 BID group.[0291] Xanomeline and trospium were absorbed into systemic circulation following oral administration of the KAR-003 formulation at all dosages. The PK results suggest that neither xanomeline nor trospium meaningfully impacted the PK behavior of the other drug. The KAR-003 formulation provided enhanced xanomeline and trospium blood levels compared to KAR-001, where both compounds were dosed apart.[0292] No new safety signals were reported with the KarXT formulation. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity with no SAEs or deaths. Subject incidence of salivary hypersecretion, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea was higher in the xanomeline + trospium arm in KAR-001 compared to the KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups in KAR-003.
